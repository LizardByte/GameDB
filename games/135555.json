On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch.\n\nUnlike the arcade counterpart, the PlayStation version does not have a combo counter. Expert mode is also missing from this version of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-append-3rdmix-mini", "videos": [{"id": 38071, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JiWclog5U0Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiWclog5U0Y", "title": "beatmania APPEND 3rd MIX mini - 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiWclog5U0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
