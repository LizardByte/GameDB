The game ends if the Liberty Star runs out of fuel, or if all cities are destroyed by Zylons.", "summary": "Star Raiders II is a video game released in 1986 for the Atari 8-bit home computers, and later several other home computers and game consoles. The game was originally developed as part of a tie-in with the movie The Last Starfighter, which featured an arcade game of the same name as part of its plotline. Versions for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were developed in 1984, although those were never released. Later the tie-in was dropped, and the game converted into a sequel to Star Raiders by changing a number of gameplay elements. The gameplay remained quite different from the original Star Raiders.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-raiders-ii", "videos": [{"id": 50407, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iabq8cSmYiE"}, {"id": 50408, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8oYFcNst1yE"}, {"id": 50409, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9OXo_3yX1Ak"}]}
