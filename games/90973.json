It takes skillful care and nurturing to grow these flowers to their full potential, but once picked, they provide their owner with wisdom. Beware, for there are others who will do anything they can to get their hands on these mystical flowers. You'll need to enlist the help of creatures native to this land to take control of the Lotus garden and achieve true enlightenment. \n \nIn Lotus, players take turns adding petals and utilizing guardians to control and nurture these mystical flowers to maturity. Collect special abilities as you grow to aid you on your quest, and gain wisdom points for each completed bloom. At the end of the game the player with the most wisdom points will emerge from the garden that much closer to enlightenment!"}
