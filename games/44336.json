{"id": 44336, "name": "Reactoid", "summary": "The latest breakthrough in nuclear power is broken. It's the network, of course. In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts. It's supposed be remotely controlled by a sophisticated network of computers, but tonight it has to be controlled by you!"}
