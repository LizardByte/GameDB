It's pretty obvious Demon Front is inspired by Nazca's excellent series of run 'n gun shooters for the Neo Geo; the gameplay is almost identical, and the art style is remarkably similar too.

To unlock the game's true ending, you'll need to find a hidden cave in each of the five levels and unlock a magical treasure hidden within.
