A lot of them paled in comparison to the original. However, in 2012, SyX and TotO decided that they'd take the matters with their own hands and create the faithful conversion of the arcade original. This is Pac-Man Arcade Emulator.\n\nA blurb from AmstradToday:\n\"This is like a childhood dream that come true. But at first, we have to go back a \"few\" years ago. While the CPC is at its apogee, clones of the young game Pac-Man flower. But honestly it is far from equaling the sensations of the fabulous game created from the mind of Toru Iwatani, offering a brilliant concept with mechanics far more complex than it seems.\n\nMarty, we're back in this good old 2012! But Great Scott, from what toilet bowl they slipped to imagine offer to the CPC its first emulator? Because it is really a fullspeed arcade emulation! Offering smooth animation and nice graphics near the original ones in mode 1 (4 colors) to bring to perfection the experience, everything or almost is here. There is no impact on the game but collected fruits are not displayed on the screen. No other aspect is missing like the eyes of the ghosts that indicate the direction they will take at the next intersection and a special menu permits you to completely configure the game. Pac-Man, the one and only in your CPC!
