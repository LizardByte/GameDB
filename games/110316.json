It's a town where any Tom, Dick or Sally can get themselves a license to solve crime, or failing that: a gun, a reputation and a bad attitude. \n \nThe game is due for release episodically, for iPhone and PC, some time in 2013. \n \nIt's a commercial follow up to Ir/rational Redux, which garnered over half a million plays web-wide, and a coveted 4/5 user score on Newgrounds. In fact, if you want to know what Ir/rational is, you can play it right now!", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ir-slash-rational-investigator", "videos": [{"id": 25620, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "dcWUD9hMGtQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcWUD9hMGtQ", "title": "Ir/rational Investigator Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dcWUD9hMGtQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
