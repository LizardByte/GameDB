A small radar shows the positions of the enemies and landing platforms (where the jet can be refueled and re-armed). The jet is capable of shooting diagonally downwards now, and there are more versatile enemies. Apart from helicopters that directly attack the jet, there are also unarmed support helicopters that drop anti-aircraft guns and radar jammers. There are 15 levels of difficulty and the next level is reached once a certain number of helicopters is destroyed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/falcon-patrol-ii"}
