If you are annihilated in battle, \"Razy Points\" will increase. If this increases, you won't be able to see the true ending.\n\nIn this work, you can create a group with multiple characters and act for each group. When there are multiple groups that can act, it is possible to switch using the function called \"channel change\". I want to change the group to operate according to the situation and cooperate with each other to advance the game.\n\nEach character appearing in the game consumes \"ability points\" obtained by defeating enemies in battle, and the value is arbitrarily assigned to abilities such as \"attack\" and \"defend\" by the main character. The assigned points can be used again.\n\nIn addition, you will learn unique \"special skills\" depending on your personality and characteristics. In special techniques, there are special attacks, recovery, attack assistance, etc. You can launch a powerful attack by \"collaborating\" with your friends.\n\nAlso, in case you don't know the progress or destination of the game, \"I'm going to the countryside.\" It is equipped with a function where you can see such a \"synopsis\" and a \"whole map\" that allows you to check your current location and destination.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sepas-channel", "videos": [{"id": 54142, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oM-DIoSskis", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM-DIoSskis", "title": "G-MODE\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b928 \u30bb\u30d1\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3000\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oM-DIoSskis/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
