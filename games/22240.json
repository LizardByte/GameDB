However the person who sent him has never before been seen and it is never revealed why exactly he is carrying out this mission. According to the original Twisted Metal created in the year 1995, in TM:B the entire storyline is darker, and is referred to as an \"alternate universe,\" in comparison to the other Twisted Metal games. As stated, it is because it is all in Needles Kane's head. But there is even more to TM:B. Black, the driver of Manslaughter, made an appearance in TM(1995), Darkside's driver Mr. Ash's \"lost\" ending. In that ending he wants his demon \"black\" back, which makes one believe Mr. Ash is Satan. When he gets Black back, Calypso gets very upset. This is because Black is sent on a mission to kill a darker, more evil Calypso in the \"Black\" universe.", "summary": "First offered as a freebie in the United States with purchase of a PlayStation 2 Network Adapter for its initial release (and later included again for free as part of the Greatest Hits package for Twisted Metal: Black,) this online version of the hit car combat game features all of the cars and carnage of the original game across all 18 stages (including all full stages and mini-stages from the full game) of TM:B. The violent cinemas and story mode were excluded in this network-only version (partially to tone the ESRB rating down to a T), but the multiplayer modes for online play still include all four modes -- deathmatch, last man standing, collector, and manhunt -- and options for power relic modifiers can be turned on to twist this evil game out even more. \n \nOnline play originally was limited to only 4 players (2 over 56k), and chat functionality was not included. However, via server fixes, the player count was upped to 8 online via broadband, and a chat function via USB keyboard/on-screen input was also made unlockable when a secret code is entered on the lobby screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 37642, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "A_lWh8H-0tQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_lWh8H-0tQ", "title": "Twisted Metal: Black (PS2 Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A_lWh8H-0tQ/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 37643, "name": "Credits", "video_id": "KzUzT5dBXiU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzUzT5dBXiU", "title": "Twisted Metal black credits", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzUzT5dBXiU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
