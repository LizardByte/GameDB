It was published by Koei and developed by Omega Force. The game is loosely based on the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdoms of England and France in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just like the Kessen and Musou series from Koei, certain liberties are taken from the original history. For example, unlike what happened in real life, it is possible to save Joan of Arc from being burned at the stake. A expansion remake, entitled Bladestorm: Nightmare was released for consoles in Japan at the end of January, 2015 and in western regions a couple months later. The worldwide Microsoft Windows release was on May 29, 2015.[", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bladestorm-the-hundred-years-war"}
