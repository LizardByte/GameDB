Pick letters and chain them to an adjacent letter to form a valid word. Each word you spell will earn a certain score. This score is added to your \"action points.\" If you reach a certain amount as defined by your equipped weapon, you will gain a weapon attack to use in a future turn. Rarer letters and longer words give big scores where you can potentially gain extra turns or numerous attacks! Gems on letters will double the score!\nIn addition to word-spelling, you can also cast powerful spells. These spells can change letters on the game board, heal you, damage your enemy, and can be learned by defeating foes and completing quests.", "summary": "Battle against an evil force in this unique word/RPG hybrid game!
