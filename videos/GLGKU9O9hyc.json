AIR RESCUE I challenges your skill and daring as you pilot your nimble craft through the treacherous underground labyrinth.\n\nYOUR ORDERS: Search out and rescue the captives trapped inside. Danger approaches from all sides as defenders fire winged missiles and sparkling energy bursts at your fragile craft. You are not defenseless, your explosive tipped rapid-fire missiles dart out to blast a path through the dense minefields. Thread your bomb directly into the heart of their pulsating nuclear furnace. And just when you think the path in clear, a swift patrol craft appears from behind a ledge, spitting missiles - as you scramble for firing position. AIR RESCUE I features full scrolling multiscreen scenarios, four skill levels and unique competition in solo or team configuration (pilot and gunner) for 1 to 8 players. Immerse yourself in the non-stop excitement of AIR RESCUE I. You'll keep coming back for more!!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLGKU9O9hyc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLGKU9O9hyc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLGKU9O9hyc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLGKU9O9hyc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLGKU9O9hyc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore C64 - Air Rescue I \u00a9 1984 MicroProse - Gameplay", "description": "DESCRIPTION\nZip up your flying suit and strap yourself into a sleek assault chopper II.
