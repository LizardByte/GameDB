Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.\n\nTheir colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it \"The Hippest Place in The Known Universe\". Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.\n\nThe demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.\n\nThe game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages. The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis. At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/creatures--1"}
