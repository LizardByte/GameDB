Apart from introducing pets into the game as Sims and not objects, Unleashed also offers new careers including Chef, Circus Performer, and naturally, Veterinarian. The expansion also adds 125 new objects, for both pets and people. For the first time, Sims can grow vegetables in their own garden plots. Harvested crops are stored in a pantry, then sold at a farmer's market or enjoyed by the farmers themselves. Gardening Sims may especially appreciate a devoted feline friend, who will help by chasing rabbits and gophers away from the crops.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sims-unleashed", "videos": [{"id": 52898, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "tQPMBD1_w4k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPMBD1_w4k", "title": "The Sims Unleashed TV Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQPMBD1_w4k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 52897, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Okpi8Psn4TI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Okpi8Psn4TI", "title": "The Sims Unleashed Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Okpi8Psn4TI/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 61, "name": "The Sims"}]}
