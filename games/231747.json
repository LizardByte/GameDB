First, Mario replaces Stanley (just like how an Orange Yoshi replaces him for the Modern mode of Greenhouse in Game & Watch Gallery 3). Mario and Donkey Kong also have bubble shooters instead of insecticide sprays. Plus, the setting is a Ghost House. Lastly, the bees have been replaced by a fireball and a Boo. The fireball remains in place until pushed away by the bubbles. The Boo attempts to sneak up on either Mario or Donkey Kong when one of them is busy refilling his bubble shooter. When the fireball or Boo reaches Mario's or Donkey Kong's side, whoever receives it freaks out. Unlike in the Classic version, music is featured.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong-3--3"}
