Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt\u2019s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It\u2019s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bad-north-jotunn-edition", "videos": [{"id": 47288, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8tJ-n6b8O40", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJ-n6b8O40", "title": "Bad North: Jotunn Edition Now Available on PC, Xbox One, and Switch!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8tJ-n6b8O40/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
