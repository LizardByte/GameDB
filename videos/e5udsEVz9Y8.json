In the first Deadly Nightmare game, you played the role of John, but this time around you take the role of his grandmother. Surviving is not easy, since you need to explore supernatural locations, figure out what\u2019s wrong and uncover the truth as fast as you can. \n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2676700/Deadly_Nightmare_Unwanted_Heritage/\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ElectricalEagle.DeadlyNightmareUnwantedHeritage\n\nApple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deadly-nightmare-uh/id6473384610\n\nLearn more about John\u2019s grandmother and her story \nAs we know from the first game, his grandmother dies, but we barely know any of the circumstances. All we know is that she captured the curses and John tries to stay away from them until 6 AM. In Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage, we get to learn how his grandmother tackles the curses, and we also get to use her unique powers and intellect to make that a reality.  \nJohn\u2019s grandmother lived in a mansion along with her family, also known as the Wilsons. Anna, his grandmother, also had a sister named Helen. Unlike the first game where the curse ended up going through the maid, in this game the curse goes through Helen, so you are going against the clock to try and save her as fast as possible! \n\nOpening the gate of curses \nThis time around we also need to complete the Gate of Curses mission, and we do that via finding materials and tools that are necessary to open the gate of curses and defeat the queen. However, that will not be an easy task. It requires a lot of work and attention, and you\u2019ll end up near a lot of different enemies that you will have to face. Which is exactly why you need to be very well prepared, as this is a very demanding and challenging game.  \n\nA large number of spells and creatures \nDeadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage adds a large number of new creatures, so you\u2019ll have those from the previous game and many others. On top of that, you also have realistic spells and curses. These help add to the excitement and authenticity of the game, while bringing you a very engaging and fast paced gameplay. You can even use poison to acquire supernatural powers, which will help you survive. \n\nIncredible visual effects \nThe sequel comes with an old-timey look, which makes it appropriate for the era we are playing in. We added a large variety of special effects to deliver an incredible visual style and appeal. That alone makes the game come to life, while immersing you in a very exciting and empowering world. It\u2019s what makes this entire experience well worth the investment! \n\nSurviving the ultimate scare \nIn Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage, everything is set against you, so the chances of survival are slim. Playing as John\u2019s grandmother adds a great twist, but you still have to face a lot of horror creatures and ghosts. It really helps bring in a sense of fun and excitement, while allowing you to push the limits in a very intense and fun way.  \nIf you like horror-themed, action-packed games, don\u2019t hesitate and try out Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage today.
