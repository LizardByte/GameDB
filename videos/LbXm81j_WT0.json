In the game you are called on to help our two detectives, Ally and Old Dog, escape the clutches of the Cryptic Killer, a notorious serial killer who has remained on the loose for many years. Having worked on the Cryptic Killer case in the past, our two detectives are familiar with the cryptic puzzles that are left for the victims who are forced to play his deadly game. After both receiving an anonymous tip sending them to a location in the docks of their respective home cities of Glasgow and Krakow, Ally and Old Dog find themselves trapped and in need of your help to solve his puzzles before they become the next victims of the Cryptic Killer.\n\n\nThe game is played online in a web browser with each team requiring a PC, Laptop or Tablet as well as a way to communicate. Puzzles are designed in a way to encourage cooperation between the two teams and our puzzle design is unique due to this. Each team, which can have 1 - 3 people, will see a different set of objects on their screens and need to share what information they have to solve the puzzles. Communication is key. Thanks to our artist, the graphics are of a very high standard compared with others on the market and this helps bring the game to life. The game is designed to appeal to users of all skill levels as our clue system means that even those without experience will never feel stuck and unable to progress. Reviews have been very positive so far and highlight that there is little else on the market which not only manages to pull off a communication heavy style of online escape game but one that also compares favorably to the two main contenders.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbXm81j_WT0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbXm81j_WT0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbXm81j_WT0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbXm81j_WT0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbXm81j_WT0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Unboxing the mind of a Cryptic Killer by Eleven Puzzles", "description": "A highly cooperative online escape room experience played in your browser.\n\n\nPlay now at https://elevenpuzzles.com\n\n\n\nUnboxing the mind of a Cryptic Killer is a highly cooperative online escape room experience designed to be played in around 90 minutes.
