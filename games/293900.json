However, something that had never been observed happened: as a result of a rare astronomical phenomenon of planetary alignment, a progressive zone of darkness was created in the Dolbian region, which allowed the systematic advance of Cerem's evil forces.\n\nTo contain what would be a permanent advance, since the evil creatures changed as they conquered territory, a powerful army of one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers was created among the Dolbian people, under the command of General Traulian, grandson of the great magician Cramican.\n\nIn the great hills to the south of the Dolbian capital, the biggest battle in the history of the small planet Rhadyma IV was fought. Every meter of ground conquered brought with it the death of at least three soldiers. Fearing his defeat, the terrible Lord Cerem performed his last magical ritual: Tancren, sacrificing his half-life in exchange for the triumph of his soldiers. Thus, when Cerem lost his soul, transforming into a simple monster, each soldier in his evil legion gained the strength of twenty men.\n\nThe terrible battle, previously expected to last a whole year, lasted only two bloody hours. Traulian, seriously wounded, was the only surviving Dolbian fighter and to guarantee his life, he remembered the elemental incantation his grandfather had taught him as a last hope in the event of war.\n\nNow this elemental force, pulsing in his chest, will serve as fuel to achieve his greatest goal: to defeat Cerem's troops and only then avenge the deaths of his soldiers.", "summary": "Traulian: O Ultimo General is a medieval adventure game where you take the role of Traulian, the only survivor of the Dolbian army, in the great battle against the evil forces of Cerem.
