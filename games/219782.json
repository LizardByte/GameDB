His first mission is the heist at a shopping center, his goal is to steal some things for his new boss - The Thief Guild Master. Our little robber doesn\u2019t have any thief tools, he does not know that he needs any. And of course he is also missing stealth skills, simply because this is his style.\n\nHis tactic is simple - he is hidden in toilets and waiting for the night. When the shopping center is empty, his creeping journey to loot begins. Anyway he doesn\u2019t know about security systems which are operating over the night. The Shopping center is full of patrolling security robots which are watching each corner. Those robots are looking funny and not so smart, but they have the best AI on the robotic market. Sometimes robots look like they live their own lives. They speak to each other with funny beeps and visualize what they have on their minds. When the robber is watching them for a while, he can see that they speak about luxury loot and secret rooms, providing some hints.\n\nSecurity robots are not the only thing the thief must be afraid of. The shopping center is full of security cameras which are looking for their prey. The robber must observe the position of patrolling robots and remain unseen, waiting for the right moment to leave his hiding.", "summary": "This cartoon sneaking robber will make you laugh.
