But unfortunately the patch has been invaded by a pack of evil dingoes that love nothing more than stomping on poor Ted's melons and creating a lot of havoc in the process. Big Ted has to harvest the fruit as fast as he can to save them from the invading marauders.\n\nBig Ted has to run around the melon field to collect all the fruit to advance to the next level. Meanwhile he has to avoid the nasty dingoes who will terminate him upon contact and take away one of his three lives. Ted can defend himself by picking up fruit to throw at the Dingoes to stun them for a few seconds, but the dingoes can also pick them up and throw back at him, which can prove fatal. Thrown fruit is wasted and thus can not be used as further projectiles or to increase the score."}
