During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.\n\nThe game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-warrior-iii", "videos": [{"id": 110224, "name": "JP TV Commercial", "video_id": "4mtYbTmHdYo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mtYbTmHdYo", "title": "Dragon Quest III (NES) Japanese TV Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4mtYbTmHdYo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 110225, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KXq6KwzG8iQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXq6KwzG8iQ", "title": "Dragon Warrior III (NES) Playthrough [1 of 2]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXq6KwzG8iQ/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7988, "name": "Dragon Quest"}]}
