Who or what could be trying to take over your home? Jump into your tiny, toy-size plane and fly missions of bravery to solve the mystery and save the day. Perfect your piloting skills as you dodge enemy fire, or command your fighter's missile guidance system to lock-on and crush your opponent. Perform cool aerial stunts as you speed through Jetz's realistic 3-D house. Fly at supersonic speeds using the turbo boost, then stun the enemy by hitting the air brake and stopping on a flying dime.\n\nHot Wheels Jetz delivers big fun, colorful environments, and a hangar of zippy, toy-size planes. Choose from seven different aircraft, all based on original Hot Wheels Jetz designs. Buzz through eight challenging household environments from the living room to the bedroom and out into the garage. Monitor your hits, missiles, and more with onscreen displays. You'll be asked to accept 10 missions, along with one bonus mission that must be completed to spare your home from certain doom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hot-wheels-jetz"}
