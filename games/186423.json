As the blocks drop from above move them left and right to make the perfect fit. Filling an entire line across will clear that line. 10 speed levels and 2 game modes make this game easy to grasp, but harder to keep up with in the higher levels.\n\nHave a friend join you in a 2 player game. Each player is given an identical sequence of blocks to keep things fair. Clearing 2 or more lines at a time will send penalty lines to your opponent. In Classic Mode the player whose board fills to the top loses. In Speed Run Mode the first player to get to a specified number of cleared lines wins!"}
