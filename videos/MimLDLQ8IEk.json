Yup, in Engage - Insect Island, you'll be shooting down all those damn dirty bugs as they come at you swarm after swarm.\n\nEngage - Insect Island is somewhat of a unique game when it comes to free online games.  First off, it's presented in rather impressive professional-grade graphics.  It also sounds great.  But that's not it, it plays great as well.  But let's take it step by step.\n\nThe game looks amazing for a free online game.  The graphics are of a level commonly seen with more professional and mainstream games.  Everything is in fancy 3D, including all the cutscenes and briefings in-between missions.  Of particular note are the bugs that you're shooting.  They're not just little figures flitting about the screen.  Each is a detailed model that animates nicely and has its own little unique aspect from other bugs.  Sure, you'll still see more of the same, but for the most part there's enough variety to not seem redundant.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how well the audio is done.  Your guns all sound great, and depending on where you shoot the bugs (near, far, where ever they are...  sorry, lame joke) they'll sound different when they go splat.  Each weapon sounds different too, from your knife to your pistol to your oh-crap-oh-crap-oh-crap-I'm-going-to-die panic mode machine gun.  Further, all the missions briefings are done with professional-grade voice overs.   The voice acting is actually pretty good, not quite at the level of professional shooters, but it's good for what it is.\n\nThe controls are simple if you've played similar games.  You move around and shoot things.  An interesting aspect is that you can choose to have your weapons switch around automatically, depending on whether you're attacking at close, mid, or long range.  If you want some more fine control though, you can always use manual switching.  That'll also enable you to level up your individual weapon skills in a more focused manner.  An interesting point is that weapons actually have recoil here, so you can't just place the crosshairs on a target, hold a button, and keep firing every shot into that one area.  You'll have to rely more on carefully aimed shots than on spray and pray.  Though granted, the latter is a whole lot more fun at times, especially while screaming your defiance at your monitor.\n\nAll in all, Engage - Insect Island is a great game.  Even played as something other than a free, casual online shooter it still holds up and offers a lot of bug-shooting fun.
