You can't build extra Mech Factories and have to do with the two that are included in the map.\n\nNot happy with that you must bring the units back to the beginning of the map for the level to finish, they put the factories kilometers away from the destination point.\n\nResources there are much more than enough. The enemy is walled in and will barely attack once or twice towards the very end with small pitiful armies.\n\nAll in all this is a boring tutorial like level. But I still have to build 40 mechs quickly, so this is what i do:\n\nThe cost for the mechs will be 3000 food and 5500 carbon. On top of this we have to add the carbon for the gathering points, the two worker speed upgrades, and the food to get extra workers, you get three power droids and you only need to use two so energy is fine.\n\nThe game will be faster if there's a better split on workers gathering carbon/food so that you can start building mechs sooner _non stop_ that is the workers shall get enough resources to build the next batch of mechs while the current batch is processing. But also your food gathering has to be big enough to also support training workers non stop until the perfect number of workers is met.\n\nSince to me its a complex calculation I decided to get the food first and then the carbon, after playing a while I decided I needed 14 getting food to be able to build strike mechs and workers at the same time.\n\nBut then comes the fact that the units have to walk to the destination point, strike mechs are faster and for that they must be built last not first. At least your foud last batches. Mech Destroyers walk slowly and if they are the last batch then you will wait more for the end of the mission.\n\nAfter playing more, 20 getting carbon is good enough to build slowly, to build non stop you'd need more, but Mech Destroyers also spend a lot of food so 14/25 wont do. I just go 20/13ish and alternate Mech Destroyers with Strike Mechs and calculate on the run if I got my goal food, when I decide I met the goal I move all the food workers to carbon sites getting enough carbon to finish the Mech Destroyer production and then complete the Strike Mechs.\n\nTo speed the level you'd need to figure out the perfect split from the get go, that way you won't lose time moving your workers from one gathering site (food) to another (carbon).\n\nOh I kill all Mynocks since I am not hunting them and they will only block the way of my units, be it workers or mechs running back to the transport. At the end I destroy everything on the way of the mechs, and since I am at it I destroy everything else that can be destroyed as well :3", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8pntxL6tvo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8pntxL6tvo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8pntxL6tvo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8pntxL6tvo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8pntxL6tvo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "(OLD) Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns Speedrun - Confederacy - 2 - Part 1", "description": "Mission 2 - Building the Army\nAll: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=FF9A01B16B372F25\n\nHD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8pntxL6tvo&fmt=22\n\nVideo has a copyright claim due to the SW music, blocks the video on 244 countries (lawl), so I muted the video section to make it available again.\n\nOn this mission you must build twenty Strike Mechs and twenty Mech Destroyers (booring).
