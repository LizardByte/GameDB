The best way to describe Thumpies is a rhythm game crossed with juggling. Press number keys on your keyboard to match the beat of bouncing Thumpies, creating layers of a song. Tap the targets in time to make your Thump-o-Meter rise, but miss or tap out of time and the meter falls. Unlike typical rhythm based games, Thumpies has you bouncing in time instead of just following a series of notes. Unlock more Thumpies characters by collecting butterflies, but be warned--hungry Thumpies might just eat them up! Thumpies features quirky characters and a unique musical score from award-winning composer David Kerr.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thumpies", "videos": [{"id": 80700, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "E1O7WKvBtu8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1O7WKvBtu8", "title": "Thumpies iPhone trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1O7WKvBtu8/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 80701, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eZuDCczq17k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZuDCczq17k", "title": "Thumpies \u2022 Trailer \u2022 Mac\u200f", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZuDCczq17k/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
