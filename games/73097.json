He has tracked the burial site down to a plot in the local churchyard, but the parish priest won't let him dig there. As luck would have it, the man due to be buried there is on his last legs. Unfortunately he has vowed never to die until his last wishes are fulfilled. He's been tucked up in bed for ten weeks now; the old guy means business. Your task is to help him shuffle off this mortal coil and, consequently, gain access to the burial site.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-trials-of-odysseus-kent"}
