For both the story and visual style I took inspiration from \"The thief of Bagdad\" a 1924 classic silent adventure movie with Douglas Fairbanks. Game mechanics are of classic ultra-hard side shooter. In particular I was inspired by \"Agony\" a beautiful yet unforgiving Amiga game from the 90s.\n\nFinally most of the enemies come from \"Kunstformen der natur\" a book by Ernst Hackel full of litoghraphic illustrations of bizzare creatures perfectly organized with Prussian precision and devotion to symmetry."}
