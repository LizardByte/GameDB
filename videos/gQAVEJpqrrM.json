Like every other arcade game they did in the early 90's that wasn't called Cotton, it got cancelled before release.\n\nDue to some drama around the leakage of this proto, it's not supported in official builds of MAME, although there is a way of tricking MAME into running it. (Unfortunately, this method has the side effect of not allowing you to use the bomb button. Using RetroArch or HBMAME are currently the only ways to play this with bombs enabled. I was forced to use regular MAME for this playthrough because reasons.)\n\nAccording to the attract mode, our deep lore goes as follows:\n\n\"It is said that when the flux of time called up from the ancient spatial-temporal dimensions elapses, each and every grain of sand clad in scorching heat will change the world into a cardinal red inferno. The two elite female sorcerers in their effort to perpetually freeze time, attempt to release a hourglass into the yellow murkish sky by collecting the rock crystals contained in the six columns of sand monuments -- with the aid of OOPARTS\"\n\n.... well, throwing an hourglass in the air to prevent the heat death of Earth is more initiative than certain world leaders have made. I'll take it.\n\nVery stylish surreal atmosphere, courtesy of Hideki Tamura's artwork and Nasu Kazumi's soundtrack. Similar vibes to Panorama Cotton, which both men coincidentally also worked on. \n\nAs with most Arkanoid-likes, you control a paddle, and maneuver a ball around the screen, destroying all obstacles to advance to the next stage. This game sets itself apart by including boss battles in every stage, as well as a Wall Shake mechanic, that allows you to alter the trajectory and momentum of your ball by ramming into the sides of the screen, thus granting you greater control over your movement than your average Arkanoid (careful not to overuse it - the walls break when slammed into too often!)\n\nThe game also has 4 different bomb attacks that automatically cycle every few seconds (again, inaccessible in regular MAME.) Press the B button when the Magic Eye displays the desired color to release it. They are as follows:\n\nBlue Bird (purple) - homes in on enemies\n\nLine Barrier (blue) - causes a tidal wave to slowly descend from the top of the screen; the ball bounces upward off of it\n\nFlying Squirrel (red) - trails your ball, attacking everything in its path\n\nReflect Zapper (yellow) - fires a straightforward shot that after exploding on contact, will then fire two horizontal shots left & right\n\nThere's also several power ups to collect, some more helpful than others.\n\nHourglass-shaped thing with the arrows pointing outward - increases paddle size\n\nHourglass-shaped thing with the arrows pointing inward - decreases paddle size\n\nDiamond - extra bomb, can carry a maximum of 6\n\nHeart - extra hit point, can carry a maximum of 5. First one awarded at 100K, all additional hearts at every 200K afterward. Occasionally can be found inside of gold domes during stages\n\nPsikyo bomb - basically the \"illusion\" power-up from Metal Orange\n\nRed Psikyo bomb - cuts thru solid objects\n\nBlue Psikyo bomb - slows your paddle down. avoid if possible.\n\nIf you light up all 6 pads on the floor the same color, interesting things happen. All reds causes an arrow to appear above the Magic Eye; let the ball land squarely on the Magic Eye to activate a super attack (which will either destroy everything on screen, or activate a floor barrier protecting you for 1 hit.) All blues take you to a secret stage called Oasis. There's probably other cool cryptic stuff to discover, but I doubt I'm coming back to this one anytime soon. Let someone else take up the mantle. \n\nFingers crossed for Samurai Girl leaking next?", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQAVEJpqrrM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQAVEJpqrrM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQAVEJpqrrM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "OOParts - 1,013,480 pts.
