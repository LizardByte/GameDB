Expect wild adventures with cannon firing, pistol shooting, swashbuckling sword fights, and plenty of pirate shenanigans. This action-packed hack'n'slash features fierce hand-to-hand combat, hordes of enemies, and a classic fighting system with flashy combos and epic finishers.\n\nThe game underwent several iterations throughout the 2000s and was last showcased in 2010 before vanishing for years. Now, we are excited to bring it back, combining its original glory with a series of modern improvements for today's gamers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/captain-blood--2", "videos": [{"id": 130217, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "CvbIpApjrPA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvbIpApjrPA", "title": "CAPTAIN BLOOD ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CvbIpApjrPA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
