It's a big improvement over Turbo OutRun, a game I'm not especially fond of, and while it's not as iconic as the 1986 original, it's a pretty darn fun game. Interestingly, you can feel the influence of OutRunners in OutRun 2: Coast to Coast, which looks and handles similarly to its 2D forebear.\n\nOn a technical level, the transition from the venerable Motorola 68000 CPUs used in previous super scalar hardware to RISC-based MIPS architecture in the System 32 hardware resulted in an upswing in processing power, used to good effect by enabling a head-to-head versus mode in dual cockpit configuration. Despite these improvements, it becomes evident that the sprite scaling tech at the heart of these games had started to reach its limit; the \"next big thing\" would really be the move to true 3D, which Sega achieved in magnificent style in 1993/94 with Daytona USA.\n\nAs a footnote, I wonder whether the introduction of System 32 hardware explains why so few of the games based on the platform received home conversions. It wasn't until the introduction of the Sega Saturn that gamers got to enjoy arcade-quality versions of OutRun and Afterburner, but I wonder if the System 32 was beyond the 2D capabilities present in the Saturn?\n\n00:00 Kenya Course\n05:07 Spain Course\n10:00 The Atlantic Course\n15:00 Switzerland Course\n19:50 Northern Europe Course\n24:46 Russia Course\n29:36 China Course\n34:29 Japan Course\n39:14 Honk Kong Course\n44:12 Australia Course\n\n#outrun\n#sega\n#retrogames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-QTLEmizmg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-QTLEmizmg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-QTLEmizmg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-QTLEmizmg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-QTLEmizmg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "OutRunners Longplay (Arcade) [QHD] [All Routes]", "description": "Developed and published by Sega in 1992\n\nThe third and final game in the classic super scaler series of OutRun games takes things to a new level, featuring a huge number of routes through the game, and a big selection of vehicles to choose from.
