Mortals could ascend to the Gate to obtain divine power in order to assist in the search for the Emperor's missing daughter. Unscrupulous individuals took advantage of the Emperor's gesture, and caused the mortal world to descend into chaos. The lives of the common folk were filled with anxiety and weariness. The god Fuxi and the goddess N\u00fcwa took pity on the people, and along with Zhuanxu, convinced the Queen of Huaxu (\u83ef\u80e5\u4e4b\u4e3b, based on Lady Huaxu \u83ef\u80e5\u6c0f) to close the Gate forcibly with great sacrifice. After this, no one could reach the Heavens through the Gate, and no god could go to the mortal world; thus came about the Isolation of the Heavens and Earth (Jueditiantong \u7d55\u5730\u5929\u901a). Time passed, and the mortal realm suffered due to disasters and endless conflicts over claims to rule, embroiled in political instability and riotous events.

Together, they fight to bring the nefarious plots of a mysterious group of conspirators consisting of the followers of Gong Gong (\u5171\u5de5), the water god who had been sealed away for his violent actions, led by his second-in-command Xiang Liu (\u76f8\u67f3), as well as Qing Yu (\u9752\u6986), the avatar of the World Tree Jian Mu (\u5efa\u6728) who has been driven by hatred for humans and vengeance against those of the Xuan-Yuan bloodline as well as his former lover Lan Ling (\u85cd\u9234), to an end before ruin befalls the world.", "summary": "The \u201cXuan-Yuan Sword\u201d is an epic oriental RPG series with 25 years of history.It elaborates on the very heart of this series, the idea of \"one, looking at the same thing from different angles, may come to different conclusions. \" through a variety of historical incidents in different times.\n\nFeatures :\n1.
