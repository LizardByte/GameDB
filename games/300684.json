At the beginning of the game, you receive a mission, and through it, you might figure out in which city the Drummer is located. But there are also clues that you can win or earn. There are plenty of video clips with the Tripplets, and you'll see them as encouragement when things go well - or not so well... You can have up to five real players taking turns, or if you're playing alone, up to five opponents who are in the game. This game was released to promote and train for the Swedish edition of \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\"", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sverigespelet"}
