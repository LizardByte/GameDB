As you level your character up with gameplay, the number of cards you can have in your deck increases to a maximum of 10. The cards have a rating from 1 to 5 stars based on the rarity. While a rare card will have stronger abilities and attributes, it also has a longer wait period to play once it has been drawn. The cards in your deck can also be upgraded to a maximum level of 10. You upgrade your cards by trading in duplicates or unwanted cards in the enchanter area. As cards are upgraded their attack and health increase. Cards will also have additional abilities that are unlocked at levels 5 and 10. This has the potential to transform a weak 2 star card in your deck into a useful addition at level 10.\n\nThe game has a lot of depth to it and it will take a little time to explore and understand each component. We broke down our review into two parts, the first is strictly gameplay so you understand the basic concepts. The second part dives into each of the game areas and explains in further detail. Overall the game is pretty addictive, but not well known, and I would highly recommend it if you enjoy card games. The game provides a map feature that allows you to work through levels to gain gold, experience, and the chance at receiving cards and runes from treasure chests. The developer also does a great job adjusting the content based on the time of year, and offers seasonal events and cards. One area you will definitely want to check out is the clan function. Players have the opportunity to join clans and work together to obtain higher level cards and rewards. This is a great aspect and allows you to earn a gold reward each day when you log in. Finally, this game does have a pay component if you choose to use it. You can purchase gems that will allow you to purchase packs of cards. You can also purchase packs of cards with gold, but that is limited to 1-3 star cards. For the chance to get 4 and 5 star cards in a pack you will have to make purchases with gems or fire tokens. The good news is that both can be earned by completing the many achievements the game provides, so don't think you need to spend any money to enjoy this game.\n\nOverall a great card game that I really enjoyed playing. If you think this is for you download and give it a try.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbxgWTWPRvI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbxgWTWPRvI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbxgWTWPRvI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbxgWTWPRvI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbxgWTWPRvI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Elemental Kingdom iOS/iPhone/iPad Gameplay and Review Part 1", "description": "Website: http://mgvidz.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MGVIDZ1\n\nElemental Kingdoms is a collectible card game the pits you against either the computer opponent or other players.
