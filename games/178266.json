Sometimes.. They're very VERY bad days.\n\nHoward Hill was a quarry town, built in the 90s, and eventually abandoned shortly after the surrounding factories and neighborhood came up. Violent crimes and missing persons lead to the shutdown of the quarry, and the people moved on. It laid deserted for years, only ever coming to attention when people would mysteriously disappear.\n\nBeckett, a nearly retiring local detective, and his partner Fairchild, are tasked to investigate Howard Hill for any evidence of the disappearance of a young girl. When the two detectives get on-site, they split up to check the place out. That's when things start getting strange.", "summary": "This single player horror adventure positions the player as Beckett, and follows the strange occurrences that proceed as the player dives deeper into the secrets of Howard Hill.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haunting-on-howard-hill"}
