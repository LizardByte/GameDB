A King has not ruled the shattered land of Pendor for many generations.

A tale of a champion who comes from a distant shore and unites the lords of Pendor under a single Ruler and brings peace and prosperity once again to this ravaged war-torn land. All is not as it seems as there are many powers who have their own ends in mind and an epic struggle is about to unfold.\n\nStrap on your sword, and buckle your imagination. Prepare to enter the world of Pendor and accept the challenge of the Prophesy - if you dare.\n\nA total conversion mod of Mount & Blade Warband, it introduces entirely new factions, overhauled mechanics, deep immersion, and a completely original story filled with fleshed out characters, kingdoms, and mythologies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prophesy-of-pendor", "videos": [{"id": 125220, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w1SvdlvDXt8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1SvdlvDXt8", "title": "Prophesy of Pendor 3.9 | Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1SvdlvDXt8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
