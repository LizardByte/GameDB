The search for the guardians of good dreams (and defenders from those bad ol' nightmares) takes players through six massive 3-D worlds, from a pirate's cove to a moon populated by savage dinosaurs, intergalactic aliens, and many other characters direct from the subconscious.\n\nJust like the \"real\" dream world, players can transform into different characters with special traits. Need stealth? Assume the role of a sneaky ninja warrior. Feeling super? Battle the baddies as a powerful action hero. Successfully negotiating the levels requires skilled jumping, swimming, butt bouncing (better seen than explained), and more. It's not just another action-adventure--it's the game of your dreams!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/40-winks", "videos": [{"id": 2007, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W-aM_1LwKiA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-aM_1LwKiA", "title": "40 Winks - Starting Trailer PS1  (Full HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W-aM_1LwKiA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
