Specifically, the game is based on the 44 episode 1992-93 anime adaptation with the same name, and features most of its cast of characters in the roster. The game includes two modes: a single-player elimination tournament against increasingly difficult computer opponents, and a versus mode for up to two players.\n\nIn the single-player mode, the player can only choose from two characters: Phoenix and Tiki. The two characters fight almost identically. They fight through the other six characters from the versus mode and a \"clone fight\" against the character they did not select. Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bikkuriman", "collections": [{"id": 3759, "name": "Bikkuriman"}]}
