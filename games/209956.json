The difference in this version is that bubbles cannot bounce on the walls; the player can only release them vertically. The game features characters from various Taito games, such as Bub and Bob from the Bubble Bobble series, Tiki from The New Zealand Story, the dwarves from Doko Doko Don, and others.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popn-pop--1"}
