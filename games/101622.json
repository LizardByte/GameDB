They don't let me escape from this damned place... How can I make them let me go?\n\nBe careful, it's dangerous to go at night to the haunted forest. However you have to be wary even in the daytime, and if the strange entities start to chase you, run for your life!\n\nAt the end of the game (if you're lucky enough to make it through \u2013 it's not so easy to survive here) you'll find out what brought you to this creepy place. ...And the moment when you'll discover the truth will be as much horrible as all the events you'll witness before it.", "summary": "Fading Visage is a mystical horror game where you are to explore gloomy locations and reveal a terrible secret.
