As it turns out, Galactic justice doesn't screw around, and in a touch of Imperial Roman flair, you've both been tossed into a labyrinth to duke it out with each other gladiator-style. Only one will emerge alive. \n \nEach player is given a ship, which can shoot in four directions at once. The arena's layout changes on every round, but the premise remains the same - maneuver your combat ship around the playing field, use the walls for cover, and kill your opponent. The first player to win ten rounds will emerge victorious.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/batalia"}
