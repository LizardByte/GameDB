I adopted research techniques from ethnography and history, such as open-ended interviews and participant observation, and developed a method of representing the results of this research in a playful and interactive form that draws heavily from familiar interaction design patterns such as the tamagotchi-style virtual pet and role-playing game multiple-choice dialogue systems.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
