They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2004. This game was made with two different casings but the game itself remained the same in each.\n\nThe game has two buttons which control left and right movement. The object of the game is to keep the flowers thrown by Cheese from hitting the ground by having Cream catch them. If 30 flowers are caught the level will be increased by 1 and the game speed will increase. If 10 flowers are missed the game will end.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cream-flower-catch"}
