Pitted against each other in free-for-all combat, contestants must use power-ups and weapons, such as giant staplers and rubber ducky grenades, to flatten their opponents. The game's various modes have you fighting to collect resources, fending off a horde of man-eating chickens, or exchanging blows in fierce deathmatches. There are more than a dozen levels--including an arctic pipeline, a Christmas tree, and a kitchen sink--for you to conquer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/whacked"}
