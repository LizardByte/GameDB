This 6 SP map episode, also including a start map, end map, cutscenes, and 5 DM maps, has stood the test of time as one of the most atmospheric experiences available. Using the episode's additions to full effect, Zerst\u00f6rer has an atmosphere of unparalleled bleakness and inhospitality - and sometimes outright scariness. In this way, it enhances the dark, gothic aspects of Quake.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zerstorer", "videos": [{"id": 66110, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JsjIgbFIWnU"}]}
