The princess of the kingdom Styla is adored by all except the witch Lady Maud who despises the princess' fashion sense. She decides to put a curse on her that forces her to wear a hideous jumpsuit at all times. As a result, the citizens are afraid to show their own fashion sense fearing that the witch will curse them too. To solve this problem, king Tuft calls for a hero who can lift the curse. Link, answering the king's call, travels to the castle to fight alongside other heroes to defeat the witch and bring peace to Hytopia.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes is the direct sequel to The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. The game is similar to the Four Swords games in which Link is accompanied by two other Links in the game's multiplayer mode, but it also allows for a single-player mode in which the other Links are replaced by animated dolls that can be swapped out during the game. The three Link can cooperate in a variety of ways to solve puzzles and coordinate their attacks with the help of on-screen notifications that give clues on what to do.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 4455, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1mptQhqArcA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mptQhqArcA", "title": "The Legend of Zelda Triforce Heroes; E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1mptQhqArcA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 82161, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "HHiHmsK6lcw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHiHmsK6lcw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes - The Princess's Tell-All Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HHiHmsK6lcw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
