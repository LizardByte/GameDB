The letter informs them of a terrible disaster: Mangar's master, the Mad God Tarjan, has unleashed his wrath upon the town of Skara Brae, completely destroying in. The heroes visit a refugee camp nearby and embark on a quest to defeat Tarjan. \n \nThief of Fate is the third installment in the Bard's Tale series, and a sequel to The Destiny Knight. It is similar to its predecessors, being a first-person fantasy role-playing game in which the player explores maze-like pseudo-3D towns, dungeons, and wilderness areas. Two new character classes have been added: Geomancer and Chronomancer. There are more dungeons than in the previous games, and this installment also adds an auto-mapping feature. The game's world is divided into separate realms accessed by using time warps, each with its own theme and setting - including, among others, famous locations from Earth's history such as ancient Rome or Berlin during World War II.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-bard-s-tale-iii-thief-of-fate", "videos": [{"id": 30616, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "a2r4lvRLnlw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2r4lvRLnlw", "title": "The Bard's Tale 3 - Thief of Fate (1988) PC 1st-person Fantasy RPG", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2r4lvRLnlw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
