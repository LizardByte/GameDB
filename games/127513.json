Set in the persistent fictional universe of Corepunk, it's inhabited by four main unique cultures.\n\nThanks to the top-down camera and fog-of-war, you'll want to discover every last nook and cranny. Find a chest filled with loot, a rare monster, a wandering merchant with special items, or even a new event - the possibilities are endless.\n\nIn PvP, the top-down view and fog-of-war give rise to new tactics and strategies: ambushing, rushing from out of nowhere, luring foes into a gang hidden in the shadows. By controlling the distance between you and your enemy, keeping an eye on your abilities' cooldowns, and knowing each character's strengths and weaknesses, you'll even be able to conquer enemies apparently stronger than you. Victories against other players are rewarded through the Honor Points system. A karma system prevents weaker players from being steamrolled.\n\nCorepunk also offers everything you'd expect from an MMORPG: crafting and mining professions, arenas and battlegrounds, guilds, farms, pack deliveries, quests, randomly generated dungeons, raids and profound lore. This eclectic game rolls all of your favorite settings and themes into one: cyberpunk and steampunk, dark fantasy, and science fiction.\n\nKill monsters, defeat champions, discover a new world, build new relationships. Create your own story. Corepunk welcomes you, Adventurer!", "summary": "Corepunk is an MMORPG with fog-of-war in a seamless open world.
