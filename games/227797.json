Features set for the future include an exclusive Team Chaotix Mission Mode, 8 Unique Playable Main Characters (7 of which are playable in this Demo), a fleshed-out Tiny Chao Garden, New Levels and Music Tracks, and more! For this particular Demo, Sonic's Insta-Shield is swapped-out for his Drop Dash! This move will be an early unlockable in the final version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-advance-revamped", "videos": [{"id": 78961, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qBI59gB9NYE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBI59gB9NYE", "title": "Sonic Advance Revamped SAGE 2018 Trailer Clip (READ DESCRIPTION)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qBI59gB9NYE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 78962, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "Q6VkT_6CQII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6VkT_6CQII", "title": "Sonic Advance Revamped SAGE 2017 Demo Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6VkT_6CQII/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 78963, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "SykSXQVKUd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SykSXQVKUd8", "title": "Sonic Advance Revamped: New Intro and Title Screen!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SykSXQVKUd8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
