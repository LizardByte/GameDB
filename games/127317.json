It's so dangerous, It easily kills your time! You could solve the Eulerian circuit problem with delicate real-time rhythm control. You should be careful, or you could lose your chance to clear the game. \nIt's so easy to play, not easy to conquer. There are from easy maps to hard-core maps, and you can easily make your unique map by the built-in map-maker."}
