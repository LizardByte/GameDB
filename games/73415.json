Players will have a main playbook representing one of the aspects of the setting, but will portray multiple characters including the patrons themselves. The setting elements, the patrons and the obstacles they struggle with are generated by the players over the course of play. Night Caf\u00e9 is inspired by games of belonging outside belonging and the principles of Powered by the Apocalypse. To play you need this zine, a single six-sided die, some index cards or scrap paper, a good amount of coins or beads, a few pens or pencils, and a single paintbrush.\n\nThis game touches on issues of mental illness, addiction, self-harm, and violence.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-cafe"}
