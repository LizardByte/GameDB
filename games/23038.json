Without using the Electro Bolt, you must activate the Ferris wheel controls using different weapons and Gene Tonics. Instant Piano Prodigy is a new Tonic that can also be found. \n \nWorlds of Hurt takes place in a series of combat rooms with different enemies. Clear a room to win money and ADAM so you can buy new ammo and Plasmids. \n \nA new Game+ mode also lets you replay the main game with any abilities, inventory, and weapons that you collected previously. There are 12 new trophies to acquire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
