I have not, for my lineage granted me audience with Memory, and I have spoken with the Wheels of Lull. I have seen proof, as any who come Up during Landfall Season, when the winds die down enough Above that all may make pilgrimage under the banner of Vehk and Vehk. Though many Above have renounced Memory, they too remember.\"\n\nFar, far below Nirn, past the lava flows and the still-mining machines of the dwarves, lies the great Clockwork City of Sotha Sil. Two centuries ago, an individual stepped through its nonexistent gates, forever changing it and its residents. From his actions came the Chronographers, the fabricant time-keepers, and watchers of the world. Since those two centuries they have lived in the great voidyards and helipads of their ruined city, silently guarding the world from danger.\nBut now, deep beneath the Throat of the World, in the most destitute of their outposts, something dangerous is stirring, and the rejected and broken Chronographers of Lull-Mor find that they have no choice but to seek outside help, and once again bring a mortal hero into the depths of the Clockwork City, to stop a mad mystic and his army of twisted experiments from unmaking the very foundations of the world! So once again, descend into the Expanse of Sotha Sil, and once again, turn the Wheels of Lull.\n\nThe Wheels of Lull is an enormous, sprawling expansion sized quest mod that serves not just only as a sequel to Sotha Sil Expanded, but ties together almost all my previous Skyrim quest mods, including Aethernautics, Mzark, and even Brhuce Hammar. In it, the player is recruited into the ranks of a rejected Chronographer platoon, and shunted off to the Clockwork City outpost of Lull-Mor, a precariously perched outpost at the edge of Sotha Sil's domain.\nMuch like Sotha Sil Expanded, the mod gives a focus on puzzle and problem solving. Featuring five enormous dungeons, with mini-bosses, unique treasures, and plenty of puzzles, you'll have your work cut out for you. The player will find themselves exploring strange new landscapes, from the deepest oceans, to underground forests, to giant foundries, and going up against strange new monsters, while wielding several new weapons, from the Harquebuses of Chronographers, to the great Unwinder of Goveri. They will find themselves dressing themselves in Chronographer robes. WoL also serves as introduction to the stranger side of TES lore, diving into the strange and ridiculous world of TES metaphysics, and will teach players about the Towers, Landfall, and the eponymous Wheels of Lull.", "summary": "Return to Sotha Sil and enter the stranger side of TES lore, as you join the ranks of the mysterious Chronographers in this fully voiced DLC sized quest mod that adds over 10 new quests, multiple new armors and weapons, sprawling dungeons, unique boss fights, and much much more!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-wheels-of-lull", "videos": [{"id": 133239, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4Dr-PycdJ4w"}]}
