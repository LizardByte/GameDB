Sword of Heaven and Earth is a Japanese ROM hack of FE7. It's full-length, and has dozens of new characters, including some old favorites like Dorcas, Guy, and of course Ephidel. While it's a very fun campaign to play, unfortunately it's very imbalanced, as some characters are just godlike and most mages are absolute junk. You see that Valkyrie I have? 24 max HP.\n\nStill, it was a lot of fun, aside from what I believe to be the most insane final boss in Fire Emblem history. Julius? Ashnard? Those guys are pussies compared to this FE1 Medeus-style dark dragon. 37 defense, 37 guaranteed damage, 3 range...I can't use Luna because the Shamans suck, and I can't use the Sol Katti because I broke it MANY chapters prior. That leaves the Dragon Axe and two really good Warriors with a nice big support bonus going. If you play this hack, basically use everyone I did :P\n\nOh yeah. That Hero that died is Dorcas's daughter, so...oops.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n94QRCXjHh0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n94QRCXjHh0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n94QRCXjHh0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n94QRCXjHh0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Fire Emblem: Sword of Heaven and Earth - Final chapters", "description": "I had this footage lying around for awhile, so I got around to uploading it finally.
