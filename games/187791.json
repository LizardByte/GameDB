Military view. If you see a spear with a flag over one of your cities, it means that you can create an army in it. Simply touch and drag from it and you'll see the army path. Army will capture cells around its path. The same dragging way is used to plan the movement of your existing armies. Also you can see the cells defense ratings on this view. Cells are defended by nearby armies, cities and forts.\n2. Diplomacy view. Here you can select a country and see its current enemies (red) and allies (green). You can select a country and suggest a treaty to it, or declare war. Also here you can answer the treaties suggestions from other players\n3. Economy view. You can see how much each of your cities brings to you, and set the funds spreading to war, peaceful growth and treasury. You can fund new cities and fortresses in this view.", "summary": "Conquicktory is a minimalistic turn-based strategy focused on top-level decisions in your civilization's development. You'll control the diplomacy relations with neighboring countries, declare wars, plan the key strikes and distribute funds to the peaceful/military issues. Your subjects will do the rest of work - there is no need to deeply micromanage all the aspect of your glorious growing empire.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conquicktory"}
