The game is way to long and repetitive and this video is way to long due to playing on ACE difficulty and me playing badly, at least initially. This is an ace combat wannabe.\n\n There are something like 30/31 missions in the game and every mission is the same. Kill x amount of planes and maybe the odd building. The number of planes get higher each mission. Usually there is FMV to look forward to at the start and end of each mission, but by the time you get to around mission 15, the middle of the game the game devs were getting bored to and the number of fmv clips drops significantly.\n\n There is no sense of speed in this game and air combat is literally just about circling each other until you can lock on and fire. Thank god flares are infinite as you need them all the time. The enemy will often fire them on top of you as well meaning you have no chance to evade. It becomes a real pain later on when the enemy get an armour boost meaning I need 2 or 3 rocket hits to get a kill.\n\n At the end of each campaign, you take on a boss. You have to take on a an armada to get to it first however. Once the boss appears you get one chance to take it down. It will fire missiles constantly meaning you have to evade and launch flares and while you are doing this you cant shoot the boss down. The trick is to fire everything you have left at it once it first appears. Try to launch flares and evade all at the same time. While he is in front you, you have a very slim chance of winning. If he goes past and you need to chase him, you may as well give up. If he gets you, you have to play the whole mission again from the start of course.\n\n The only good part of the game (I am. clutching at straws now) then its the fmv sequences staring James Tolcan reprising his role from the film. The game really should have been 15 levels at most.\n\n After completing the game, you get to go on a bonus mission. It starts of fairly simple and with 15 nukes should be a cakewalk right? WRONG! As the level progresses, the enemy fighters come in greater numbers and more aggressive. The bombers are going after the helicopter and if you use nukes, you are likely to hit the helicopter. It can take a few hits but its not a good idea to hurt it yourself. The final plane is a boss plane and it will destroy on sight given half the chance. You do only get one chance and you should take it. I literally unload every weapon I have saved up for it taking a tonne of damage in the process as its near impossible to evade.\n\n After completing the bonus mission, a cheat mode is displayed but I haven't got it to work so not sure where it is meant to be applied.\n\n 00:00:00 Intro and Miramar Missions\n 00:35:44 Cuba\n 02:05:01 Korea Missions\n 04:12:25 Libya Missions\n 05:47:42 Bonus Mission -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAI0f54J0ZY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAI0f54J0ZY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAI0f54J0ZY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAI0f54J0ZY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [383] Top Gun: Fire at Will", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nWhat a bloody awful game this is.
