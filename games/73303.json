Your mission is to destroy all the crazy aliens flying around in the various underground caverns and when they're clear, move on to the next cavern. There are a few different aliens types in the new caverns, but the color of the caverns changes every level. This game is a crude clone of Konami's classic 1981 arcade hit, Scramble. You control your ship with the standard Apple II keys A, Z, arrows, spacebar.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cavern-crusader"}
