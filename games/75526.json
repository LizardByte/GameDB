It is based on the 1993 film of the same name. The game cabinet resembles the rear of the Ford Explorer tour vehicles used in the film. The player, equipped with a joystick, must shoot dinosaurs that appear on-screen throughout the game.\n\nThe game is notable for having a moving seat, also used in Sega's previous 1991 light gun shooter Rail Chase. The seat is powered by hydraulic pistons to move the seat according to action on the screen. The game's graphics blend two-dimensional sprites and three-dimensional polygons to give the sense of movement. Jurassic Park was the first game of this genre to include 3D environments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jurassic-park--4", "videos": [{"id": 16661, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "l6I-4CcKAXo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6I-4CcKAXo", "title": "Arcade Longplay [001] Jurassic Park", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l6I-4CcKAXo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
