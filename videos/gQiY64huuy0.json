Enjoy...! \n\nHunter: The Reckoning \u2013 Wayward is a 2003 hack-and-slash video game developed by High Voltage Software and published by Vivendi Universal Games for the PlayStation 2. It is set in the World of Darkness, and is based on the tabletop role-playing game Hunter: The Reckoning. It is a sequel to the 2002 game Hunter: The Reckoning, and is followed by 2003's Redeemer.\n\nPlayers take the roles of hunters who fight a large amount of enemies using melee and ranged attacks, and magical abilities, progressing through missions and areas in a non-linear manner. The story is set two years after the previous game, and sees the hunters returning to the town of Ashcroft following the appearance of a cult and supernatural beings there.\n\nThe game was announced in early 2003 as a port of the previous Hunter: The Reckoning game, but with a new story, and with gameplay changes made based on player feedback. It was released to \"mixed or average\" reception, with reviewers frequently criticizing how the game's multiplayer mode only supports up to two players concurrently, compared to the first Hunter: The Reckoning's four, but praising the game's controls and gameplay improvements.\n\n#playstation #topdownshooter #longplay #fullgameplay #fullwalkthrough #fullgame #zombiesurvival", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQiY64huuy0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQiY64huuy0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQiY64huuy0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQiY64huuy0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQiY64huuy0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "(L:77) Hunter: The Reckoning - Wayward PS2 Longplay", "description": "a full game/walkthrough/playthrough of Hunter the reckoning wayward on playstation 2...
