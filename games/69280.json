You can battle against the computer or head to head against a friend in Exhibition, Season and Series games in historical ballparks like Ebbets Field and the Polo grounds. This game combines old time traditions (Home Run Derby, baggy uniforms, manual scoreboards, echoing announcer), and modern day baseball (radar gun, pitch location screen, updated pitcher/batter reports).\n\nAnother feature is that some of these superstars use their actual motions. See Willie Stargell's famous batting style, Juan Marichal's high leg kick delivery, and Babe Ruth's home run trot, just to name a few.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aaron-vs-ruth-battle-of-the-big-bats", "videos": [{"id": 122781, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "x479OZn1HmY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x479OZn1HmY", "title": "Aaron vs. Ruth: Battle of the Big Bats (PC) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x479OZn1HmY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 122782, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "F3YA0YgT1xk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3YA0YgT1xk", "title": "Aaron vs. Ruth: Battle of the Big Bats (PC) - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3YA0YgT1xk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
