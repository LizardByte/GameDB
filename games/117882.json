Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army.", "summary": "Kratos, the once mortal warrior turned ruthless god, sits atop his throne on Olympus as a threat far worse than his predecessor Ares had ever been, striking down anyone who crosses his path or the path of his beloved Sparta.
