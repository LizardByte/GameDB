Then, as though they had been cursed, a great ice age began. Soon all the inhabitants and creatures of Merin were forced to seek shelter in the great underground caverns of the terrible Tarturian. Generations passed and slowly the great ice glaciers receded and the survivors returned to the above ground, but the only source of light and heat, the eternal flame of WAU, had been taken by the Tarturian. Many parties, such as yours, have returned to the caverns in search of the flame, but none have succeeded. Often the moans and cries for help are heard filtering up through air passages, crevices and volcano vents from the caves, coming from parties that have grown to weak or lack enough survivors to continue. They are doomed to wandering aimlessly or meeting their fate at the hands of creatures, slave traders or the Tarturian.\n\nMany of the earliest inhabitants of the caves hid their gold and treasures for safekeeping; then they becam entries on the scrolls of fate. Many other search parties left weapons scattered about the caves. The weapons and gold coins are protected by forces that make them invisible, except to those carrying any or all of the ten treasures of Merin. You must find these treasures and enough weapons to outfit your party for your final attack on the Tarturian, attempting to recover the flame of WAU - unprepared will result in your swift termination. Your party is like a string chain and at least one fully-equipped member of each type must be present in order to hopefully succeed in the attack. There is no way to leave the Tarturian's chmaber once you enter...", "summary": "You prepare your characters to to defeat the Tarturian in a final battle.
