Lacking the strength, wealth, or abilities of reavers, most humans have no choice but to sell themselves into virtual servitude in order to make a living.\n\nThe most common form of entertainment in Chanelcrest are arena-style tournaments that pit two humans up against each other for sport, with reavers called Ringmasters dictating their every move. It's such a lucrative business there are facilities that train humans especially for this purpose.\n\nThat brings us to Lilith Hall.\n\nInside this all girl training facility, humans undergo a strict regimen of schooling and physical training to prepare them for the harsh world of the arena. They're taught from birth that their only purpose is to serve their future Ringmaster as Harlequins that act as equal parts battler and servant. With not even a name, the trainers refer to them by numbers, telling the humans their future Ringmaster will name them if they so choose.\n\nThe road to being a Harlequin is filled with pain and suffering, but it's the only life they've ever known.", "summary": "080 is the pride of Lilith Hall.

All her life she was taught the only thing that matters is her future Ringmaster; but when an outsider is brought in, she gets a taste of what the outside world looks like. She must choose between a temptation she's never known, or the life she's always wanted.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lilith-hall"}
