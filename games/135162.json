Experience unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.\n\nAs a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.\n\nA mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.\"\n\nThe Complete Edition of the episodic game Song of Horror, original available as a bundle of the base game and it's season pass.\nIt has replaced the original Song of Horror page, episode 1, on steam.\nA bundle is available, discounted based on episodes already owned, for returning players to upgrade to the Complete Edition.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/song-of-horror-complete-edition", "videos": [{"id": 37507, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "zL-bzkMrFME"}, {"id": 37508, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "j0UNPgz0gK4"}]}
