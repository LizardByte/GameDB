I see, I see...), and publised by Taito, the same one of Bubble Bobble.\n\nIn fact, the first Don Doko Don plays almost exactly like Bubble Bobble, but instead of being cute little Dinosaurs that use bubbles to defeat foes, the players are Dwarves that use hammers to do the same thing.\n\nThe sequel is a different thing, single player only, and a platformer with a (silly and simple) story. And of course, a japanese only release. The game made it outside Japan, but only as a bootleg/pirated Super Mario game, found in either single game carts or multi-game carts. \n\nSo, yeah, until some time the game was Japanese only, because Mr. Richard999 and Guyver (X.B.M.) did a translation patch. It's... okay, I think that it can be improved, but it's a start.
