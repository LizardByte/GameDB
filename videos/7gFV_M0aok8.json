These resources are necessary for many reasons:\n- To keep the main character alive by eating and drinking.\n- To craft new items, tools and consumables\n- To upgrade the base camp in order to improve its efficiency and unlock new crafting recipes.\nCombat is the other core aspect. Players can fight enemies belonging to 3 different factions (bandits, indians and dinosaurs) by shooting them and by using melee weapons or explosives and other AoE throwables with various effects.\nAll of this gameplay takes place inside procedurally generated areas that belong to different biomes such as canyon, swamp or mountain.\nPlayers must spend at least one day in each of these areas before traveling to the next one.\nThey can choose the following area through a 2D map interface that also tells them the traveling time and the type (exploration, shop, special event or boss).\nThe game\u2019s difficulty is directly related to how much time the character spends traveling and exploring.\n\n#UnityGame #IndieGameDev #UnityDevelopment #DinoPathTrail #GameDev #IndieGame #GamingCommunity #Unity3D #DinoGame #WildWestAdventure #GameArt #UnityGames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7gFV_M0aok8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7gFV_M0aok8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7gFV_M0aok8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7gFV_M0aok8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7gFV_M0aok8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dino Path Trail | Trailer", "description": "WISHLIST DINO PATH TRAIL ON STEAM:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2481670/Dino_Path_Trail/\n\nJOIN US ON DISCORD:\nhttps://discord.gg/MN4c9Ksu6Q\n\nFOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dinopathtrail/\n\nFOLLOW US ON X:\nhttps://twitter.com/DinoPathTrail\n_____________________________________\nDino Path Trail is a 3D isometric roguelike survival shooter based on exploration, gathering, crafting and vitals handling.\nPlayers explore an area looking for resources to gather.
