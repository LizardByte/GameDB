The ship is equipped with three upgradeable weapons, a limited arsenal of bombs, and a boost capability that grants temporary invincibility and recharges after use. Each weapon is more effective against certain types of asteroid and enemies than others. Items include weapon upgrades and a shield that absorbs one fatal hit against the player's ship.", "summary": "Super Stardust HD is a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3 video game console, developed by the Finnish company Housemarque.
