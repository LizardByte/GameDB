After the events of the previous two chapters, you find yourself rescued from the grave by rebels, among whom you are now a valuable asset. Taken to a makeshift field hospital, you recover in the hands of rebel medics. But the Combine are determined to crush the rebels out of existence, and the peace can't last long. You will face choices, and how you decide to proceed will ultimately dictate how the story plays out for you. Some choices are less obvious than others, and require you to take initiative where you otherwise might be distracted. One way or another, it's time to take back the city."}
