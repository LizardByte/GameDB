It consists of two major parts:\n1) A virtual world map as the matchmaking room: meet people from all around the world and find your perfect match. Exploring the match room is a lot of fun in itself. Fly around, collect some gems which you might need later in the game.\n2) The actual connect 4 matches: To make this classic more exciting, you have limited time to complete your turn and you will loose health points if you missed it. Also, do not place your avatar offside, or you will loose more health points.\nBe sure to delight your opponent player with some extra struggles. For instance you can create a game quake to make it difficult for him or her to exactly position his or her avatar. Or you can shorten the amount of time available for your opponent, shoot with baseballs, position turning windmills, hide your move or place a bomb to remove a threatening disc of your opponent. Some of the \"attacks\" (game quakes, time shortening) can even be defended.\nAfter the match has finished you can send a message to your \"opponent\".\nIn the menu you can click \"Recent Matches\" - there you will find all matches you played in recent days. In this dialog you can \"like\" other players. That is, you can permanently see them in your \"Liked Players\" list and directly invite them to matches when they are online.\nYou can also check messages received form other players.\nNo game account needed. Just make sure that you have an iCloud account and that you have enabled iCloud Drive! No costs, no ads, no in-app purchases. Just fun playing. We hope you enjoy this game and we appreciate any feedback or thoughts you might have.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/connect-4-faces-match-and-play"}
