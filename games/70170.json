Gameplay is based on running a rally stage - a twisty section of road with snow, mud, asphalt or dirt. The player can choose to run a single stage, a \"ghost race\" against a previous run, or a championship season.\n\nFor the championship, you race all of the stages available against up to 9 other players - either human competitors or computer AI. As the races are done without any other cars on track, it is done by turn-by-turn. The game also offers a replay mode with the ability to save. Through a serial link or over a network, you can race against another human player.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rally-challenge", "videos": [{"id": 144174, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0U46jcFUMzM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U46jcFUMzM", "title": "Rally Challenge (1997) intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U46jcFUMzM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
