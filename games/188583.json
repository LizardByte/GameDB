Each player pursuing their own goal until they change sides.\n\nBut to have any chance of winning you have to move fast, be very smart and be attentive to many things while the rest of the players drive you crazy with an arsenal of diseases and dodgy treatments they can throw at you, among other things.\n\nCourage!
