This is a small portion of what would be a larger game and currently takes about 10-15 minutes to play. There is just the one ending with the choices only making small changes to the story flow and appearance. \n \nI made this game to explore different things I had learnt to do making the previous short game. \n \nI'm working my way up to being brave enough to try make a point and click adventure game next, so I'm enjoying using this to practice backgrounds and tiny puzzles. \n \n Unfortunately this is a shelved project as it was made to see what I could get done in a month for the game jam, there are many errors and I learnt a lot along the way which was my goal, to learn and grow. Sadly I couldn't pull together a full game in the time frame of one month and only managed to create a small section of a larger game."}
