Beyond-Human builds upon the classic open-world Metroidvania style by mixing a deep hack and slash combat system, exploration, and 16-bit pixel art. The combat is inspired by an exciting mix of the Metroid and Devil May Cry franchises. The combat may feel similar to people that have enjoyed Devil May Cry and Guacamelee. Melee combat is all about performing combos that are easy to do but hard to master. You will also unlock new weapons by defeating bosses and mini bosses to improve your arsenal.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 15685, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "g8sk8b16GAM"}]}
