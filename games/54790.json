Sears Tele-Games later re-released it as Race; no changes were made to the gameplay. Included with each game was a set of two driving controllers, which were identical in appearance to the 2600 paddle controller but could rotate indefinitely in either direction, among other differences.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/indy-500--1", "videos": [{"id": 15441, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "yJlOERmMJGw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJlOERmMJGw", "title": "Classic Game Room - INDY 500 review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJlOERmMJGw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
