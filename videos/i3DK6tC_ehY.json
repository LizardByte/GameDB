The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.\n\nA group of humans, calling themselves 'The Stalkers,\u2019 discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.\n\nHumanity found the \u2018Seal of Night,\u2019 an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day.
