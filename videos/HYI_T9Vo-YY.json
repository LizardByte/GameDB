It was kinda hard, though... Last levels are pretty challenging. But other than that it's a short, but fun ride. I just recently watched the movie and the game follows the event of that movie pretty fine for a mobile game. It has a variety of different weapons and you really need to use them all, which is cool. Overall, the game is pretty repetitive - just unlock doors and fight generic enemies. But the game is too short to be really bored. Oddly enough, in this version every sound plays only once...\n\n\n0:00 - Menu\n1:11 - Level 1\nThe whole level is easy, you're just using your fists to fight cops and that's it.\n4:14 - Level 2\nOkay, now Blade has his pistol. Fists are good against cops and pistols against generic... female vampires? They look kind of female.\n7:22 - Level 3\nFor most part the level is pretty much the same, as the previous one, but you get the sword by the end of it and there's even a boss fight. Well, this boss will appear again, but the battles have no difference at all. He's kinda hard if you don't know what to do... Just click him to death is not an option.\n10:40 - Level 4\nA new weapon gets unlocked on this level, but for now it's not that useful. The sword will do its job perfectly fine. The same boss in the end of the level.\n13:13 - Level 5\nIn the end of the level you get the last weapon, but I really don't know why you needed. Besides using it in the boss fight, which is reeeeeally simple, by the way.\n17:06 - Level 6\nThe last level and it's kinda hard! You need to be reeeeeally careful. This time that saw blade will help a lot. And the level ends with the last 3rd defeat of Drake. Yeah, this game is not really good in terms of bosses.\n\n\nAnd by the way, I've found a debug menu and lots of cheats here, they might really help you if you struggle, but still want to beat it just for the sake of it.\n\n\n----------------------\nWalkthrough playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNGa1kVSWDk0NsgvPWso83hKEW-AqlVLQ\n\n\nPlayed on PC using KEmulator.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[100%] Blade: Trinity (Java) v 1.0.2 - Walkthrough", "description": "Well, of all MForma's games this one wasn't that bad.
