Zeon Forces from around the world have decided to withdraw. This is the story of their heroic battle to retreat.", "summary": "Return of Zion takes place in UC 0090, where Zeon remnants are taking part in a large-scale operation to consolidate their forces and retreat into space to join Char Aznable\u2019s own nascent Neo-Zeon.\nThe game focuses on a group of Haman\u2019s Neo-Zeon in Africa called \u201cNightshade,\u201d as they link up with other remnant groups and representatives of Char\u2019s Neo-Zeon to ultimately return to space.\nReturn of Zion\u2019s character designs are handled by prolific Sunrise designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, and fits well into the aesthetic he established with his work on Gundam 0083. Playing up the anime style, each mission is actually bookended with an opening and ending sequence, and even a \u201cNext Episode\u201d card.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobile-suit-gundam-return-of-zion"}
