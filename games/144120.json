Every cat appearance will net the player a coin, and each repair on the machine utilizing these coins gives another can of cat food.\n\nA kitty photo album not only fills up with images of each unique cat the player sees, but also allows them to see all of the animations from the original game. New cats exclusive to Collections will also appear.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cat-busters-collections"}
