Siel, the Lady of Time, gave her life to establish a massive Aetheric Field, and by these actions prevented Atreia from being destroyed outright. The Aetheric Field caused the ancient, sacred lands around the tower to be locked in stasis, and banished all who would threaten the tower's sanctity.\n\nOne thousand years after the Cataclysm, the Aetheric Field is shrinking. With the thawing of time, the lands have once again awakened, and the Cataclysm has slowly started to progress again and threaten the existence of all Atreia.", "summary": "This expansion reveals the truth behind the destruction of the Tower of Eternity and introduces a new character known as the Archdaeva. Besides an increased level cap and the opportunity to now further specialize your character by raising select base stats, it sees the players' journey through two new lands, Iluma and Norsvold, before ultimately arriving at the place where it all began: the Tower of Eternity itself.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aion-echoes-of-eternity", "videos": [{"id": 34657, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0jJVAMSnv2k"}]}
