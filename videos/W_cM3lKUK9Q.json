To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. On his way through the camp though, he realises how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems.\n\nInspired by games such as Prince of Persia (1989) and Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Exoddus, Ministry of Broadcast revives the spirit of classic cinematic platformers where players need nimble run-and-jump reflexes as well as a healthy aversion to falling from precarious heights. To reach freedom and family, you must lead the protagonist through each of the Arenas while under the ever-watchful mechanical eye of the Regime. The variety of hazardous, dilapidated environments hold an array of obstacles for you to manage\u2014leg-shattering drops (scared of heights?), flaming barrels of garbage (extra-smelly, extra-flamey), inconveniently-placed spike pits (of course), hanging steel beams (so much rust)\u2014but none of this is to speak of the fates of those you meet along the way.\n\n#ministryofbroadcast #nintendoswitch #nindies", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_cM3lKUK9Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_cM3lKUK9Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_cM3lKUK9Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_cM3lKUK9Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_cM3lKUK9Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ministry of Broadcast - Official Announcement Trailer", "description": "Check out early gameplay from Ministry of Broadcast.
