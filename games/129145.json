There are new power-ups added such as a Sheild that increases jump height, and a reset power-up which resets the level.\n\nThis lets the player search for color monitors they may have missed, sonic has no new moves, same as Sonic 1, this means no Spindash. The game features an intro cutscene aswell.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 33412, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IUwldG8IYuU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUwldG8IYuU", "title": "Sonic 1 Color Contrast Opening Cutscene", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IUwldG8IYuU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
