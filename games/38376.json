The games development was very troubled and took four years instead of the planned two. Upon release it sold very poorly, even after being promoted through Nintendo Power. This caused the plans for Lennus III to be shelved.\n\nThe magic system have been expanded to eight spirits representing the elements Fire, Light, Wind, Gold, Earth, Sky, Water and Void. Which can be combined or used separately for a total of 36 spells. Instead of building up a spirit skill rating by using the spells relating to the spirit, in Lennus II you power up the spirits by defeating monsters and earning spirit-specific experience points in addition to the normal experience points.\n\nA Nintendo Power version of the game was released in 1997.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lennus-ii-fuuin-no-shito", "videos": [{"id": 42891, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aMJ1BoDIT50", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMJ1BoDIT50", "title": "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u300c\u30ec\u30ca\u30b9II \u5c01\u5370\u306e\u4f7f\u5f92\u300d\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aMJ1BoDIT50/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 5086, "name": "Lennus"}]}
