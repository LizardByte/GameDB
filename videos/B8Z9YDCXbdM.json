{"id": "B8Z9YDCXbdM", "snippet": {"title": "X3: Farnham's Legacy - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Ten years after the release of X3: Albion Prelude, Egosoft is revisiting the X3 universe. X3: Farnham's Legacy is a new chapter in the popular X3 series, created over the past five years by long-time community members, in close cooperation with the Egosoft team. What community members may have thought was an April Fool's joke, actually exists and will be released on May 4th, 2021. With three games released between 2006 and 2011, and over 2 million copies sold, the X3 series remains a fan favourite.\n\nSet in the years after X3: Albion Prelude, as the chaos caused by the gate shutdown really takes hold, X3: Farnham's Legacy starts very differently to previous games in the X3 series. Trapped in an isolated area of space, players will first need to make use of the new exploration features to find their way back to civilisation. Afterwards, they'll be able to use the new diplomacy options to help shape their relationships with the factions they find.\n\nThe new features don't end with the storyline, though. There are numerous other improvements, ranging from drone carriers, station-building services and an enhanced player headquarters, to a new ship browser and a hyperlinked encyclopedia. And of course, no new X3 game would be complete without new ships and stations!\n\nX3: Farnham's Legacy will be released on May 4th, 2021. The best news of all, however, is that this new expansion will be FREE OF CHARGE to all owners of X3: Albion Predule on Steam!\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Find X3: Farnham's Legacy here:\n\u25aa\ufe0f Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/483330/X3_Farnhams_Legacy/\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Follow us:\n\u25aa\ufe0f Community: https://forum.egosoft.com\n\u25aa\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter.com/EGOSOFT\n\u25aa\ufe0f Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/EgosoftGmbH/\n\u25aa\ufe0f Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/X4Foundations/\n\u25aa\ufe0f Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/egosoftofficial/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8Z9YDCXbdM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8Z9YDCXbdM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8Z9YDCXbdM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8Z9YDCXbdM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8Z9YDCXbdM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "X3: Farnham's Legacy - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Ten years after the release of X3: Albion Prelude, Egosoft is revisiting the X3 universe.
