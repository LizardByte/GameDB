The US version of the game was also the first of seven games from the company to display the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \"Winners Don't Use Drugs\" screen during its attract mode - the others are Steel Gunner 2, F/A, Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Knuckle Heads, Lucky & Wild, and Numan Athletics. Exvania and Super World Court, which were Japan-exclusive, may also feature the screen in their attract mode if the \"Display FBI Screen\" setting in the games' options menus has been set to \"Yes\".", "videos": [{"id": 15981, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "IyoVlt0UuF0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyoVlt0UuF0", "title": "Tank Force | 1991 | Namco", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IyoVlt0UuF0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
