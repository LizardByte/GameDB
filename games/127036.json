Reception to Burial at Sea's two episodes was mixed. While the return to Rapture was generally praised, the first episode drew criticism for its short length and a lack of differentiated gameplay. Reviews for the second episode were more positive, with multiple critics calling Burial at Sea a fitting swan song for Irrational's work on BioShock, as the studio reorganized.", "themes": [{"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea", "videos": [{"id": 31859, "name": "Trailer - Episode 2", "video_id": "k9Mp3Fguyw0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Mp3Fguyw0", "title": "BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode Two Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k9Mp3Fguyw0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66922, "name": "Trailer - Episode 1", "video_id": "Mv3FhE6_TK0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv3FhE6_TK0", "title": "BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mv3FhE6_TK0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
