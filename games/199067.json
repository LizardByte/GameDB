Without just one of those, you'll die several times.\n\nThis is the mod for everyone who craves (or simply wants) a hardcore version of brutal doom since it brings the intensity of Brutal Doom up to a 10 on a 1 point scale of badassery. If Project Brutality is like Brutal Doom on steroids, this version is like Brutal Doom on speed and crack cocaine.\n\nMonsters are up to an extreme level of relentlessness. For instance, the zombies are more accurate, have faster fire rates, and fire faster tracers. Imps can throw up to four fireballs in a single charge and they have a flamethrower attack for close range combat, their balls also scorch the ground for a maximum insult to injury.\n\nBarons and knights can sprint and jump at you, often reaching you sooner than you could imagine, and Barons can throw small BFG rounds at you. Archviles can summon monsters very fast and their fire-rape leaves continuous flames on the ground. I'll leave the Cyberdemons and Masterminds to your imagination since what they do is not pretty at all.\n\nThe good news is that the player is given many advantages. Unlike BD Redemption, where Doomguy is weakened to reality, both Doomguy and his enemies are tougher. Doomguy's attacks very efficiently with fast reloading, punching, shooting, and the assistance of an item store.\n\nSome new weapons include the pistol, SMG, Auto-Shotgun, sniper-rifle, Dual-Chainsaws, and Cyberdemon's Rocket launcher (which is only available in the Heavy weapon class). Many weapons have a new tertiary fire; like adjusting the sniper scope, malt-rounds for the minigun, Rocket launcher grenade mode, and the dual wielding function was moved to the tertiary fire mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brutal-doom-ali-jrs-challenge", "videos": [{"id": 67526, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qpxtZBUst9o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpxtZBUst9o", "title": "Ali's Brutal Doom v0.8b RELEASE TRAILER!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qpxtZBUst9o/sddefault.jpg"}]}
