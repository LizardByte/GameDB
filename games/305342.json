It has always had a dreamlike atmosphere to it, and this new adventure really leans into that aspect. Work on this hack started in summer of 2021 with the intention of only making a slightly dreamier variant of the original, but it slowly became its own distinct project. It features new overworlds, towns, dungeons, graphics, and text.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zelda-ii-paracosm"}
