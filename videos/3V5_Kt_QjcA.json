{"id": "3V5_Kt_QjcA", "snippet": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [207] Worms", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nWorms is a turn-based artillery strategy video game developed by Team17 and released in 1995. It is the first game in the Worms series of video games. The player uses a team of Worms against other teams of Worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The goal is to kill the Worms on the other teams using various weapons and be the last surviving Worm(s).\n\nGameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence (which is determined randomly) across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move one of its Worms. Worms can walk, jump and attack/use tools. Each worm begins the round with a specific amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options. When hit with a weapon, the Worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A Worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked outside or below the level.\n\nCluster Bombs are extremely powerful in this game. They are like slightly weaker Banana Bombs, and you start with five of them! The Uzi and Shotgun are both useless as they do little damage and are not safe to use at close range and at obtuse angles.\n\nThe Game Boy port has much better physics than the SNES and Genesis ports, the AI is smarter too, it even seeks out weapon crates and uses special weapons. Fire Punch doesn\ufffdt destroy terrain, and Blowtorch and Drill are not present. This version does have Homing missile. The pieces of Cluster Bomb now seem to work differently, as they deal damage to Worms before the game makes them scatter or hit terrain, making this weapon even stronger that in the other ports. The Instant Death mode was replaced with automatic draw.\n\nThe controls are hard to get used to, which takes away from quality of the game because the original Worms were praised for ease of accessibility. The biggest problem is lack of color, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe. The game doesn\ufffdt show Worms\ufffd names during turns, only interchangeably displaying their health and ID numbers of their teams. Also, your turn doesn\ufffdt end if you take damage from your Shotgun in this version.\n\nThis game has no story/arcade mode. I show all modes, teams and all weapons. At some point I just stand and do nothing for a while to let the round timer run out so that I can show what happens. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3V5_Kt_QjcA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3V5_Kt_QjcA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3V5_Kt_QjcA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [207] Worms", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nWorms is a turn-based artillery strategy video game developed by Team17 and released in 1995.
