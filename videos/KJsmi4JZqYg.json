Development was underway at 3D Realms in parallel with a number of other well-known titles. Following the success of Duke Nukem 3D, development progress was made public starting in June 1996 with weekly updates on their website. It was originally scheduled for release in early 1997. On January 22, 1997, a press release announced that all rights had been sold to Monolith so that 3D Realms \"could focus efforts on Shadow Warrior,\"[citation needed] another Build engine game slated for release the same year. Released on May 31, 1997, Blood utilized an enhanced version of the Build engine from Ken Silverman which featured the addition of voxels. The game falls in the first-person shooter category, and has an arsenal of bizarre and nefarious weapons, numerous enemies and liberal amounts of gore.\r\n\r\nThe Blood franchise was continued with two official expansion packs titled Plasma Pack (developed by Monolith) and Cryptic Passage (developed by Sunstorm Interactive). Later, the sequel titled Blood II: The Chosen was released on October 31, 1998. In terms of copyrights and ownership, Monolith sold the rights for Blood to GT Interactive. GTI was later acquired by Infogrames which has since been renamed to Atari. In recent years it seems that Warner Bros. Entertainment owns the Blood trademark.\r\n\r\nA first-person shooter in the spirit of schlock horror/slasher flicks, the gameplay of Blood is witnessed through the eyes of the player-controlled character, Caleb, and consists of fighting the hordes of various enemies as he traverses the levels of the game. In single player mode, the objective of the player is to lead Caleb in his quest of revenge against his former master: this is achieved by navigating the levels of each separate episode, looking for an exit, until the \"boss\" level is reached and a showdown against a large opponent takes place. Each episode can be played separately, in no particular order, albeit these are organized to follow the game's storyline.\r\n\r\nBlood's gameplay is similar to other classic FPS games like Doom, in that the player is required to activate switches and/or seek keys to proceed through the levels; on larger maps, finding up to six different keys may be required. A classic FPS feature which is rarely employed in Blood is the teleporter. The player's progress is further complicated by different types of traps, including the classic crushing blocks, explosive barrels, or lava pits, the occasional jumping puzzle, and combination lock doors.\r\n\r\nBlood was also one of the first FPS games (along with Marathon, Heretic, Strife and Star Wars: Dark Forces) to feature \"alternate\" or \"secondary\" attack modes for its weapons; most weapons in Blood have two different methods of dealing damage, in contrast to previous games in which each weapon had only a single type of attack. Another concept added in Blood are the \"super secrets\", very hard to find and hard to reach areas which merit large rewards.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJsmi4JZqYg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJsmi4JZqYg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJsmi4JZqYg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJsmi4JZqYg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJsmi4JZqYg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Blood: E1M1: Cradle to Grave (PC) (1997) (Monolith Productions)", "description": "Classic FPS shooter, Blood.\r\n\r\nBlood is a PC game developed by 3D Realms and Monolith Productions and distributed by GT Interactive.
