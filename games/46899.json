Players control a gun at the bottom of the screen, aiming to shatter six plates positioned at the top while navigating four rows of moving targets in between. The game challenges players to balance their primary objective of breaking plates with the opportunity to score bonus points by hitting other moving objects. Adding to the challenge, ducks periodically swoop down, depleting the player's limited ammunition if they reach the bottom. A special duck traversing the top of the screen can restore shot plates if it completes its journey, introducing a strategic element to the gameplay. The game continues until the player exhausts their ammunition, which is visually represented by a bar beneath the gun, creating a constant tension between accuracy and resource management.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/duck-shoot", "videos": [{"id": 94401, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aHYLGEkWIas", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYLGEkWIas", "title": "Duck Shoot - VIC-20 Gameplay (Steam re-release)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHYLGEkWIas/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 94402, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Xp6hmTl93ac", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp6hmTl93ac", "title": "Duck Shoot - Commodore 64 Gameplay (Steam re-release)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
