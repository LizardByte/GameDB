Surrounded by ever-growing graveyards and engulfed in darkness, ShadowCrest's young girls are bound to serve the High Priestess upon their 18th birthday. All others are captured and enslaved by the order against their will and exist in a zombie-like state.\n\nDespite the fact that love and marriage are forbidden, Miranda, one of the young girls of ShadowCrest, has fallen in love with Jack, who is one of the captives. Her despair grows each night as she listens to him play the piano in the distance. She vows to free him from the clutches of the Evil Sisterhood, but she cannot do this on her own. Having learned dark magic from the gypsies, she summons the player to help her.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
