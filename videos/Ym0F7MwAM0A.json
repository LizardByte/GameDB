(https://www.youtube.com/@PatientGamerReviews) Go check it out.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, this channel, iampanax was demonetized by YouTube for \u201cReused Content\u201d.  After talking with multiple partnered channels and reading countless threads on the PartneredYoutube subreddit, the consensus is that \u201creused content\u201d is YouTube\u2019s way of arguing \u201clow effort\u201d.  Basically since I don\u2019t do voice overs in the videos and/or use a webcam, YouTube argues that I can\u2019t prove that the videos I create are actually mine.  Even though I play through each game myself and then edit them into these movies.  Just me, not a team of people like other channels, just one person in their spare time.\n\nI\u2019d love to act like money isn\u2019t a factor here, and in fact when I started creating these videos in 2013, it wasn\u2019t.  I had just played through StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm, and was so amazed by Blizzard\u2019s cinematics that I had to share them with the world.  Fast forward a decade later, and I make a little bit of money off my videos.  To give you an idea, I was making less money than a full-time employee earning minimum wage.\n\nNow, why am I mentioning all of this?  Well, the older we all get, the less time we have.  And even though I originally was creating these videos for free, once you make money on YouTube, it is considered a business by the government.  But, if you are no longer make any money off of it, it really isn\u2019t a smart decision to continue on.\n\nSo these last couple months I\u2019ve been thinking.  And I came across three decisions or different paths I could take, which are:\n1. Delete all my videos, keep the subscriber base, and transition the channel to something more monetizable.\n2. Delete the channel so that YouTube doesn\u2019t make any money off it.\n3. Keep the channel how it is and start a new one from scratch.\n\nOption 1 and 2 are similar with the mindset of \u201cif I can\u2019t make money off my videos, no one can.\u201d  But I\u2019d be deleting hundreds and hundreds of videos over the course of a decade.  Is it really worth being that petty?  The 3rd option is what I decided to go with since even though I\u2019m no longer making money on the channel, people can still watch and enjoy them.\n\nSo with all of that out of the way, my new channel is called Patient Gamer Reviews where I will reviewing games that have been out for at least a year.  I will be talking about graphics, audio, gameplay, story spoilers (with warnings), if I think the game is worth playing, and at what price point I would purchase the game at.\n\nI have appreciated all the comments, likes, subscriptions over the years and hope that you will follow me in my journey with my new channel.\n\npanax", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym0F7MwAM0A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym0F7MwAM0A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym0F7MwAM0A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym0F7MwAM0A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym0F7MwAM0A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bloodwake Full Game Walkthrough (No Commentary) 1080p 60fps (2001)", "description": "Game Movies - (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBWamHErFf9iDZxQ3QKRcQx3iJB6OOqS9)\n**THIS CHANNEL IS DEMONETIZED** (Show More for Info)\nTL;DR \u2013 This channel is dead and I made a new one called Patient Gamer Reviews.
