It's time for you to give \"Power to the People\"! Do you have what it takes to keep the lights on?\n\nPopulation is always increasing, and cities require more and more electricity in order to function as time goes by. Can you keep up with the ever growing energy demand? Remember, if there are blackouts and your customers are not satisfied, you'll be out of a job!\n\nDo you believe in nuclear power as the solution for humankind's energy production problems? Or are you more of a renewable energy fan? Or perhaps you prefer to go old school and stick to fossil fuels? Power to the People offers you a wide array of power plant types and energy storage solutions so you can design your grid exactly how you want it, while taking advantage of the local resources and climate.\n\nDon't push your substations and power lines too hard for too long, or bad things will happen and everyone will be left in the dark... And it will be game over for you!\n\nDid you think things were hard enough as they were? Well, hold your horses, as you'll also have to face solar flares, lightning bolts, trees falling on your power lines and other disasters that will keep you on your toes. Always have a backup plan, and try to get things up and running quickly again, or otherwise customer satisfaction will plummet!", "videos": [{"id": 47296, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RydMs58Ldx0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RydMs58Ldx0", "title": "Power to The People - City Power Management Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RydMs58Ldx0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
