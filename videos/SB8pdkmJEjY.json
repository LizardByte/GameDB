To finish each level, you must collect all Starcells (visible\non radar).  Energy from them gives temporary immunity from Spores launched by defending Cells. Single White Worker Cells will repair the cities but cannot be destroyed. When all levels within the current star map have been finished, you automatically enter the Bonus Game. Here you will gain a Perma-shield, and will be awarded an extra craft if you can destroy all eight workers.  Perma-shields are selected from the main menu and shield you from Spores for the duration of that level.\n\nWhen you enter a level, one Starcell will be flashing (on radar only).\nIf you collect this one before the Status Symbol counts down to zero you will gain one co-ordinate for Loopspace. When you have either completed the system or gained all four co-ordinates you will enter the Bonus Game. This allows experienced players to skip levels.\n|-----------   -|-- ----|---------|-----------|--------------|\n|                 |       |          |     -      | -      __    |\n|  3 5 8 7   |  P   | L001|  -  - -   | -        |     |\n|                 |---- --|---------| -   -     | -      --     |\n|-    -----------|  2       3     |-----------|--------------|\n      1                                   4        5       6\n                     INFOBARS\n\n1.
