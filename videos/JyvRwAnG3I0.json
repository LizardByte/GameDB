There is mainly only one game in the series, but it was ported and modified on various systems like Sega Saturn and WonderSwan and originated on the PC-98 in 1993. There is another game known as \"Debut 21\" which has some connection to the original game, but I'm not clear as to how close that connection is. The TGCD was the first home console to recieve Debut. Systematically, the game is a relatively simple management game like Princess Maker and Wangan Trial Love, but it shares its biggest connection with \"Graduation\" a series in its own right made by the same developers one year prior (1992). Debut even had a short, two volume OVA made after it that was eventually re-released on DVD in 2002.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the game is to take the role of a production manager who is trying to raise top idols and he has three girls (who are each skilled at different things such as singing, acting, modeling, etc.) to work with. First is the fiesty, red-headed sixteen year old, Aki Itoh, who is a good acter and is pretty well-coordinated, making her a shoe-in for dexterous tasks. Next, you have the gracious seventeen year old, Saori Fujimura, who is a natural born singer and charming to boot. Lastly, you have the youngest girl (who is also sixteen however), Kumi Tanaka. She is a good singer, but is fairly lacking in other areas. However, she is a fast learner and naturally talented at many things, so she progresses in stats faster and easier than the other two.\r\n\r\nYou have to lead the three to greatness and create at least one idol to take to the top. Of course, you have many tough rivals, so you can't just let the girls get too tired (forcing them to sleep and take time off from training) and you should treat them with gifts and rewards often. You can't please them all the time, but you'll be okay so long as you don't let their stats fall too low.\r\n\r\nThis video contains the intro and the whole theme song as well, which doesn't play all the way through in the Sega Saturn intro if memory serves, but goes to a convenient cut-off point. The song is known as \"Venus no Tanjou\".\r\n\r\nBasic Format: Super CD-Rom\u00b2 (Super CD-Rom2)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyvRwAnG3I0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyvRwAnG3I0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyvRwAnG3I0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Tanjou Debut [\u8a95\u751f\u301cDebut\u301c] Game Sample -- PC Engine CD", "description": "Original Air Date: November 12th, 2009\r\n\r\nTanjou Debut is a \"series\" of games that are part of what is known as \"Simulation Training\" games.
