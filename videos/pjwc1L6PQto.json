It has a good story, good graphics and is a lot of fun.\n\nIf you are the type of person who likes to play hack-and-slash games just to kill a lot of monsters, Ancient Evil will be a great game for you. If you are the type of person who likes a well-written story and a consistent plot, Ancient Evil will also be a great game for you. The plot in the game will not be clear from the start, but will be gradually revealed.\n\nIn Ancient Evil you can choose between playing a warrior, a ranger, a spellcaster and a thief. You have taken the challenge to explore the Crypt of the Ancients. For centuries this crypt has been the ultimate challenge for any adventurer. Originally, the crypt was a resting place for the ancient gods who created the world; later (about 400 years ago) a great mage called Alaric turned the crypt into an adventurer testing ground. Alaric offers 10.000 gold pieces to the adventurer who can explore the crypt and live to tell the tale. Thousands have tried and died. Only one hero, Jetraal the Heroic, succeeded. Later he died under mysterious circumstances. As you fight your way through the levels of the crypt, you will find books about the crypt and the monsters in it. You will also meet the ghost of Jetraal, and you will soon discover that an evil plot is being hatched in the crypt. You will have to figure out the plotline yourself, as it would take much of the fun out of the game to reveal it.\n\nAncient Evil is shown in a 3D isometric view, which is very nice to look at. There are a lot of different monsters in the game, and your character's appearance will change when you change his weapon or armor, so the graphics will not get boring. The sound in the game is fine, too.\n\nIt is very simple to play this game; it takes just two minutes to create your character, and the controls are simple. The only minor drawback I could find is that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate your character through narrow places.\n\nAll in all, a great game that should not be missed. \n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 8700K\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Share", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjwc1L6PQto/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjwc1L6PQto/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjwc1L6PQto/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjwc1L6PQto/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjwc1L6PQto/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ancient Evil (1998) - PC Gameplay / Win 10", "description": "Ancient Evil (1998) - PC Gameplay / Win 10\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\n\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\nUseful infos / how to run:\nhttps://pcgamingwiki.com\n\nTry these if game is not working:\n\u25aa dgVoodoo 2\n\u25aa DxWnd\n\u25aa Turn Off DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows\n\u25aa Play with compatibility settings\n\u25aa If you can't install a game in Windows 10 directly, download\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org and install Windows XP 32bit for example.Then install game there and move files to Win 10 (sometimes you need to export and edit registry too).\n\n\nAncient Evil is a hack-and-slash role-playing game, similar to Diablo.
