Once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea is now an arid wasteland, a victim of decades of Soviet cotton irrigation. To some, it is the prime example for humanity to stay out of nature's business. To others, it's a world waiting to be saved. \n \nReal-world setting: The vanished Aral Sea in Central Asia, peppered with artifacts of an all too real history. \n \nA world imagined: Eerily detailed, vibrant HD art, closely based on photos from the Aral Sea and filled with secrets. \n \nSomething to say: Experience a non-violent, thought-provoking, fully voiced story concerning the cost of saving worlds, without giving up control. \n \nExploration: Explore an interconnected game world using three characters with very different abilities. \n \nVariety, variety, variety: From climbing to exploring to diving to navigating pitch-black corridors, integrating new gameplay elements at every turn."}
