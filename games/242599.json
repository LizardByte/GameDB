You play as one of several classes (Data, Engineering, Leadership). Each with its own area of ownership, and dependancies. Alone it is impossible to add value, but by co-operating across the various classes you are able to thwart tight deadlines, aging tech stacks, and troll submissions and in the end form meaningful friendships.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/igdb"}
