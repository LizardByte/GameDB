{"id": "Es0RrVloIB4", "snippet": {"title": "ODS Air Explorer - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Air Explorer is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997. The game tasks you with rescuing imprisoned robot Blit. To accomplish this, you must find 4 keys scattered across the United States. Upon finding all four keys, Blit is freed. He then runs across the screen and falls into a manhole, ending up in prison again.\n\nThis longplay clears all 11 levels in the game. I also showed off the edges of the map, what happens when you run out of fuel, and how if you fail a question you lose all of your current keys.\n\nThis game is a precursor to the game GeoRunner, which is an expanded version that features the entire earth. I have a longplay of that game also, I recommend looking at that one, it's a much better game.\n\nI wanted to upload this because Ohio Distinctive Software was a big part of my childhood and I couldn't find any footage of it on Youtube. Fortunately this game along with many other Ohio Distinctive games has been preserved digitally and can be found archived online. \n\nOhio Distinctive still operates but seems to be out of software publishing. Their facebook page suggests that they shut down during covid and reopened selling items such as mugs.\n\nIf you played this game please comment and let me know the when and where. My mother worked for the marketing firm that Ohio Distinctive used, so we ended up with discs of many of their games. I'm guessing that if anyone else played these games it would have been in a school setting but I'm not sure.\n\nThis session was recorded on December 9th, 2022 using DOSBox running Windows 3.1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es0RrVloIB4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es0RrVloIB4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es0RrVloIB4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ODS Air Explorer - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Air Explorer is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997.
