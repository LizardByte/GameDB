To fight them a group of brave warriors known as the Rebels Without a Cause, led by the beautiful Princess Paca Holgazana, has been formed.\n\nNow the imperialist forces are about to finalize their ultimate weapon, the Pringosa Star, a gigantic space base equipped with a terrifying planet-smashing beam.
