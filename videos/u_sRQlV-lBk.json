Save before every screen transition ideally as the encounters get stronger suddenly and sometimes you might stumble upon a late area with really tough enemies!\n\nI got lucky and got the best armor and headgear I know of from the starting enemies.. If you're wondering the items I brought were 50+ tonics, 5 revives and 1 Crono's sword, the latter being the best one available in shops but I might still get a better one from enemies. Tonics are your best friend here, since there is no healing magic! The only multi-heal in the game is the mega-elixir, costing 10,000G, which does heal hp and mp fully for everyone. (very surprising for me honestly that it works properly)\n\nThe item shop sells: Tonics (50 HP), Mid Tonics (200 HP), Full Tonics (500 HP), Ether (10 MP), Mid Ether (30 MP), Full Ether (60 MP), Mega-Elixir (Full Party Heal), Revive (200 HP revival), Revive the Second (Full HP revival).\n\nThe equipment shop sells: Helms (up to 7,800G), Armor (up to 8,000G), then weapons, always to 10,000G except the last, in this character order: Crono's, Marle's, Lucca's, Frog's, Ayla's (the latter having only one tier, costing 8,000G)\n\nThe first message you see after battle is the money earned, the second is experience, (that confused me for a while) then there are level ups, which you can tell by the exclamation point at the end of the text, then the items dropped, (no exclamation point!) which might be really good equipment, so always check your equipment menu after!\n\nSome enemies have a weakness to magic, but most times it does the same as the normal attack, so I don't bother with it much. You get new magic from set levels, these being levels 30, 50, and 70. Magic costs are: 4, 6, 8, and 10. Very rarely there are some enemies with elemental weaknesses, which will normally die from one hit regardless of the level of magic used. (I only know of two actually)\n\nSpeaking of magic, enemies have MP. If you find yourself facing a boss with really strong magic, one way to deal with them is to just heal until they run out and start attacking normally. After 4 or so turns of no magic it's normally safe to stop healing and go into the offensive. This works even (and perhaps most effectively) against the final boss!\n\nThe way to Zenan bridge is guarded by an infinity of Slashes and Fleas, which will kill your party very fast unless you set apart an hour to grind to level 40 or so. You'll reach a dead end anyway, though.
