As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity.\n\nOnce you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beethoven-the-ultimate-canine-caper"}
