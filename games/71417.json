One day a pterodactyl decides to take all the zombies, equip them with deadly weapons, and set them free among the humans. Soon other pterodactyls decided they liked this idea so much that they started helping. Pretty soon there was a huge mess.\n\nAt first the humans tried to kill the pterodactyls, but then the pterodactyls gave the humans guns, which pleased the humans. The humans then decided to kill the zombies, and the zombies grew upset because they didn't really want to kill humans. But... whatever. No one ever cares what zombies want. So the humans and zombies waged war. The pterodactyls decided that this was a great new game and began to set up battles and flew in competitors.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombies-and-pterodactyls-2005"}
