He is a safety inspector on those dystopic futuristic and surrealistic construct sites. He is having a lunch break. His lunchbox is missing though. He must find it. The hidden lunchbox much be reached before time goes to negative as this may have serious effects of thunder and lightning strikes! Thunderstom is also ignited by negative bonus score on each level. The hungry birds that eat those lovely strawberries and create minus points can achieve that. Our main hero should act fast and wise and intelligent. He should eat those strawberries before the birds to gain a huge succesful score point and to avoid the thunderstorm. Strawberries though are nothing compared to milk and sausages that the lunchbox can offer so Clark still has to find it. Strawberries give him superpower of flying though which makes life easier. There are also gravity machines, balloonmophones (to blow balloons to fly with), teleports, bombs etc etc to help Clark find and reach his beloved lunchbox.\n\n10 episodes and 100 levels of exciting and challenging FUN!\n\nFind the lunchbox without falling to death! Hit those birds to get points! Fly! Bomb! Teleport! Unscrew those steel rusty beams to create a terrible destruction in those construction sites.\n\nHAVE FUN!", "summary": "A physics based game that combines platform, puzzle, physics and hidden objects.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/acrofobic-lunchbreak", "videos": [{"id": 11882, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "NcvAKpNVlIo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvAKpNVlIo", "title": "Clarks adventure 7 exploring the menu", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcvAKpNVlIo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11883, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VPd-3U-fCoA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPd-3U-fCoA", "title": "Clarks very long adventure", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPd-3U-fCoA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
