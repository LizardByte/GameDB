When arson kills key vampires in the community, it's up to Mark to either embrace his blood or to find a way to--somehow--regain his humanity.\n\nThere are sacrifices to make.\n\nInteracting with humans and vampires is a delicate balance.

Mark's responses in the perilous community changes their reactions as well as the story's routes/endings.\n\nSurvive the night.\n\nSatiate Mark's bloodlust, otherwise he may kill innocents. The opportunities for blood will not always be private nor moral.\n\nNot all are who they seem to be.", "summary": "If you crossed a vampire, would you protect humanity or embrace the blood?
