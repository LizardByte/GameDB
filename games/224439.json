Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a basilisk climbing over the city walls and gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness.", "summary": "An HD remaster of God of War: Chains of Olympus included in \"God of War: Origins Collection.\" It features high-definition resolution, stereoscopic 3D, anti-aliased graphics locked in at 60 frames per second, DualShock 3 vibration function, and Trophies.\n\nChains of Olympus serves as a prequel, unfolding its narrative a decade before the events in the original God of War. While retaining the familiar gameplay dynamics of its predecessors, subtle modifications enhance the overall experience. Kratos embarks on a journey through various levels, engaging in relentless combat against foes and formidable bosses, deciphering puzzles based on manipulating boxes, and participating in quick-time events. Throughout his odyssey, he amasses red orbs to fortify his weapons and abilities, secures Gorgon eyeballs to augment his health, and acquires Phoenix feathers to amplify his magical prowess.\n\nThe iconic Blades of Chaos, synonymous with the God of War series, make a return, accompanied by an array of new weapons and magical spells such as the Sun Shield, Efreet spell, and Light of Dawn.\n\nThe narrative unfolds as the Gods dispatch Kratos to the city of Attica, charging him with the defence against an encroaching Persian army. However, as Morpheus unleashes chaos, Kratos finds himself compelled to harness his formidable powers to once again rescue the world from impending doom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus--1"}
