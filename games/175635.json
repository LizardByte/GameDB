You travel through three beautiful continents and slay hordes of epic mobs. As you level up, you unlock more and more maps you are allowed to venture in. These maps hold stronger enemies. All enemies in Kingdom Fall drop scrolls. Scrolls are the key to your adventure, as they will enable you to level up your skills and abilities.\n\nYou can use scrolls to upgrade your skills and abilities. Some of the skills include potent spells like the scorched earth AoE, some skills are utilities, such as dash and kick, and some of the most vital skills power up your bows such as rain of arrows or rapid fire. You can also choose to use your scrolls to upgrade attributes, like arrack speed, attack damage, and the number of arrows you can hold.\n\nKingdom fall is a very simplistic ARPG. While you are not going to find the same depth you might be looking for in a more complex ARPG, it's fun to get into and just plain fun.\n\nAs any modern ARPG, you can compete in the Kingdom Fall ladder if you chose to.", "summary": "Kingdom Fall is a simple and challenging 3rd person Action RPG where you play a druid archer that slays hordes of enemies in beautiful landscapes across the lands of a fallen Kingdom.
