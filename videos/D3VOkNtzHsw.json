{"id": "D3VOkNtzHsw", "snippet": {"title": "Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue! (PS1 Gameplay)", "description": "Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a platformer developed by British video game developer Traveller's Tales, based on Pixar's computer animated movie Toy Story 2 and is the sequel to the first game. It was released for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Windows 95/98/ME PC in 1999 and 2000. A different version of the game was released for the Game Boy Color. A sequel to the game was released 11 years later based on the third film.\r\n\r\nThe player controls Buzz Lightyear as he tries to locate and rescue Woody after he is kidnapped by Al McWhiggin, the owner of Al's Toy Barn. He can execute a jump and a double jump, as well as two attacks: his wrist laser and his spin attack using his pop-out wing tips, both of which can be charged. In addition, there are 5 power-ups that can be unlocked to help Buzz complete certain tasks. Most of the voice cast from the film returned to voice their characters in the game with the exception of Wallace Shawn who did not reprise the role as Rex (being voiced instead by Earl Boen). The game starts out at Andy's house, as Al just kidnapped Sheriff Woody. Buzz Lightyear Hamm, Rex, Slinky and Mr. Potato Head head to find and rescue Woody from Al, and enter the neighborhood, eventually moving to a construction yard and eventually Al's Toy Barn. They end up an airport, where Buzz has a final battle with Stinky Pete. Hamm and Rex are with you each level, and Slinky and Mr. Potato Head appear in multiple levels, to give you tips and bonuses. Other characters including Rocky Gibraltar, Bo Peep, Jessie and Bullseye will also need your assistance.\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen levels in the game. The levels are grouped into five zones (3 levels per zone). Only the first level is available at first, but the player can unlock more levels by collecting Pizza Planet tokens. Each level starts with a FMV scene taken from the movie (except from the Nintendo 64 version\u2014its low-capacity cartridge system meant that these movies were replaced with comic-strip type 'cutscenes'). In each level, there are five Pizza Planet tokens that the player must collect. The player must collect at least one token to unlock the subsequent level.\r\n\r\nIn the first level of every zone, Mr. Potato Head is missing a body part that the player has to retrieve in order to unlock a specific power-up. The power-ups are the Cosmic Shield (Level 1), Disc Launcher (Level 4), Rocket Boots (Level 7), Grappling Hook (Level 10), and Hover Boots (Level 13). Some Pizza Planet tokens can only be collected with the use of a power-up, while others are merely easier to collect when a power-up is unlocked. Returning to previous levels is required to obtain Pizza Planet tokens that couldn't be retrieved earlier without a certain power-up.\r\n\r\nThe tasks that Buzz needs to perform to gain a Pizza Planet token are:\r\n\r\nCollecting 50 coins for Hamm;\r\nFinding five lost items (i.e. Bo Peep's sheep);\r\nCompeting in a race against another character (i.e. RC Car) or a time trial event;\r\nSolving a \"puzzle\" located somewhere in the level (i.e. mixing primary paint colors to create secondary colors);\r\nDefeating a mini boss.\r\nThese tasks get harder as the game progresses.\r\n\r\nIn the last level of every zone, the player has to fight a boss to proceed to the next level. A certain number of tokens is required in order to access these \"boss levels.\" When the player completes a boss level, a bonus movie can be unlocked, which can be viewed at any time. In the last boss level, the player will face three mini-bosses from previous levels all at once: the Prospector (Airport Infiltration), the Gunslinger (Al's Penthouse) and the Blacksmith (Tarmac Trouble).\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\nPlayStation - PlayStation Network - Nintendo 64 - Game Boy Color - PC - Dreamcast\r\n\r\nActivision - Disney/Pixar - Travelers Tales\r\n\r\n1999", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3VOkNtzHsw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3VOkNtzHsw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3VOkNtzHsw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3VOkNtzHsw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3VOkNtzHsw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue!
