At the start of every level you start off with just one word, or phrase, visible, and from that you have to figure out your way through the ever expanding level. For instance, a level might start you off with the word Fruits, from which there would be a number of associations. One of these might be Apple, which in turn could lead to words such as iPhone, Mac, The Big Apple, etc.\n\niAssociate is a re-brand/re-launch of Mercury Mind, a game released in April 2009.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iassociate", "videos": [{"id": 92485, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "k0kSlOFrpmE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kSlOFrpmE", "title": "iAssociate - Word Association Game for the iPhone and iPod Touch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k0kSlOFrpmE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
