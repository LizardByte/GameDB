Expeditions: Rome is coming to PC later this year. \n\nIn Expeditions: Rome, you exert the will of Rome through your actions across the world stage, from the bright blue coasts of Greece to the deep forests of Gaul. Decide how people will view you, and Rome. Will you strike with an iron fist, or speak with a silver tongue? Will you embrace the political heritage of the Republic, or carve your own path as you navigate the complex politics of the Roman Senate? Every choice matters as you decide the fate of your legion, your close companions, and of Rome itself.\n\nExpeditions: Rome is developed by Logic Artists, from Copenhagen, Denmark, who were also responsible for the critically acclaimed Expeditions: Conquistador and Expeditions: Viking. But as we all know: all roads lead to Rome.\n---\nSteam: http://n.thq.com/PsHN30rG0jp\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/expeditions\n\n#ExpeditionsRome #THQNordic #LogicArtists", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ootyxaRUCXs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ootyxaRUCXs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ootyxaRUCXs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ootyxaRUCXs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ootyxaRUCXs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Expeditions: Rome - Gameplay Trailer (Male Protagonist)", "description": "The future of Rome is in your hands: What will your legacy be?
