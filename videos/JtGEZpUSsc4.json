Team up with friends in local multiplayer for 1v1 or 2v2 battles, or set up custom Tournaments for up to 12 players. You can also start a single player Career, where you start at the bottom (Bronze league) and work your way up to the top (CHL elite). Manage your roster by trading your partner and goalie, or if your team is losing, trade yourself! Keep track of all of your stats and team history in this endless Career mode, as the A.I. progressively get faster and more skilled as you move up the leagues!\n\nWishlist on Steam!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1351400/Canvas_Hockey/\n\nJoin the Discord!\nhttps://discord.gg/b5AN7H2\n\nVisit our Website!\nhttps://synvoyity.com/canvashockey/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtGEZpUSsc4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtGEZpUSsc4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtGEZpUSsc4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtGEZpUSsc4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtGEZpUSsc4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Canvas Hockey Trailer", "description": "#CanvasHockey #Trailer #LocalMultiplayer #Synvoyity\nWishlist on Steam!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1351400/Canvas_Hockey/\n\nCanvas Hockey is a top-down, arcade style Hockey party game.
