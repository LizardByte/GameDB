Good Mourning is a game that escapes any known definition of a game. \n\nGood Mourning is a narrative experiment, where the content is chosen at random for each playthrough, and the gameplay builds upon itself. Good Mourning is the world\u2019s first run-based walking simulator.\n\nReleased on Steam\u2019s Early Access October 23rd, Good Mourning introduces a game, where the story is randomly created by combining contents of dozens of levels for a single playthrough.

The content is presented through a filter of fantasy, which is further emphasized by the minimalistic and surreal audiovisuals. The narrative introduces the ups and downs of ordinary life, but it doesn\u2019t shy away from serious and uncomfortable themes. \n\nFollowing in the footsteps of award-winning Lydia, Good Mourning is a fast-paced narrative experience, which can be played over and over again, with different results.\n\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development.
