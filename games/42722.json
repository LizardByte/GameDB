The characters' hometown is Remnant Island, an island located in the center of Sciencia Sea, a vast ocean with countless islands. Shooting stars have been continually falling from the sky for some time, leaving much of these piled up on the island. Stones known as \"Star Fragments\" have been discovered in these areas. By shining a light on them in a certain way, people can see the phantom world of Lost Heaven.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-nayuta-boundless-trails", "videos": [{"id": 70187, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "EXav12w55nY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXav12w55nY", "title": "The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails - Teaser Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EXav12w55nY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70188, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vaNuRvyM3Z0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaNuRvyM3Z0", "title": "\u90a3\u7531\u591a\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1\uff1a\u6539 - \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248 2021\u5e7412\u670811\u65e5\u306b\u767a\u58f2 (Steam)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vaNuRvyM3Z0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
