Scientists working at the Moon Base are working hard to improve the capabilities of the first \u2018Materializer-ZX\u2019 (Mat-ZX) aiming to get it to a point where humans can be teleported, which they hope will help to rapidly accelerate the colonisation of Proxima B and further human expansion across the galaxy.\n\nYou are Bremner, an engineer working at the Moon Base, generally fixing things that the scientists break or lose. One morning you are outside the Moon Base with your senior colleague Mortimer, inspecting some strange mineral deposits that have recently appeared on the surface.\n\nYou have a MAT-ZX with you, useful for the canteen to teleport your sandwiches to you...although it makes the cheese taste funny... when you hear the dulcet tones of Lt.
