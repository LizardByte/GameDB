Step into the cockpit of a lone gunship and navigate your way through a labyrinth of procedurally-generated 3D levels, puzzles and foes to source valuable ancient artefacts. Descend into a vast underground facility in your mission to loot and craft ancient technology which holds the key to your clan\u2019s survival!\n\nInspired by gaming classics such as Descent and Forsaken as well as contemporary shooters like Teleglitch, Sublevel Zero\u2019s gravity-defying combat is driven by modern looting and crafting. Battle enemy fighters, surface foes and turrets who strive to halt your progress. Every shot and every decision counts as you navigate each hazard before it is too late. The emphasis is on survival and ammunition is scarce so you will need to strengthen your tactics, adaptability and skill in order to survive enemy encounters. Fly and rotate in all directions while attacking from any angle but you will have to make every shot count, as there are no saves! \n\nSublevel Zero features a highly stylised lo-fi art style with dynamic chiptune-inspired music by composer Will Bedford creating a fusion between retro and modern elements and bring to life the gameplay experience. The full game will feature Oculus Rift support, so you can experience the high-adrenaline, fast-paced shootouts up close! \n\n#SL0\n@SIGTRAPgames\n@Mastertronic\n\nhttp://www.sigtrapgames.com/sublevelzero/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/MastertronicGames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0vM4FGes3g8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0vM4FGes3g8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0vM4FGes3g8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0vM4FGes3g8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0vM4FGes3g8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sublevel Zero Announce Trailer", "description": "http://store.steampowered.com/app/327880/\n\nSublevel Zero is a first-person, six-degree-of-freedom roguelike shooter set in a universe where reality is falling apart.
