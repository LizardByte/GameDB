As such, the player can now pursue bounties in any order, and is not obligated to follow a linear questline.\n\nGunfighters, thieves, rapists, and traitors are among the quarries available to an enterprising bounty hunter. However, the player can also expect a new bevy of ambushers and assassins bent on reckoning with the player for past deeds.\n\nWith Marko still at large, the player will be compelled to track down former associates and relatives of the nefarious renegade. In doing so, he/she will ultimately find himself/herself in a rugged world space outside the Mojave, face to face with his/her most dangerous target yet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/new-vegas-bounties-ii", "videos": [{"id": 104041, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "k6z6y9a_xNU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6z6y9a_xNU", "title": "\u25baFallout: New Vegas\u2122 \u00bb\u1d6f\u1d11\u1d06\u1d06\u1d07\u1d06\u00bb The Someguy Series: New Vegas Bounties II - Complete HD Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k6z6y9a_xNU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
