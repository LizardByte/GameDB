It also was the first racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after Winding Heat.\n\nThe first and second levels contain 4 courses, ranging from grassy plains to an over water bridge to a seashore, mountains and finally a forest area. In the arcade version, 6 stages were contained. Pressing the 'B' button raises the player's speed to around 196 km/h while pressing the 'A' button skyrockets the speed to 400. The player has a limited amount of fuel and can earn more by touching special multi-colored cars. If the player collides into any other car or slips on occasionally appearing patches of oil, the car will begin to spin out and if not corrected may crash into the side barriers, causing a loss of 5-6 fuel units. The NES and Famicom version have a total of 6 types of cars, 1 yellow and red, three blue and one truck. Yellow cars will travel along a straight line and occur in large numbers. Red cars are a little less likely to appear, but they will change the lane they are travelling in once to get in the way of the player. Blue cars vary in the way they change their lane. Trucks go on a straight way, but colliding with them causes the player to crash. Konami Man will make a cameo appearance, flying by the side of the road if the player progresses to a certain point in the level without crashing (not included on course 2 in NES and Famicom versions).\n\n#nes #nintendo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Road Fighter (1985) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Playthrough of Road Fighter for NES, developed by Konami.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Subscribe for more videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCCmsDPICSz4MfC07fhoNAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dangermeat\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/danger_meat\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/danger_meat\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dangermeat\n\nAbout the game:\nRoad Fighter (\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc, R\u014ddo Fait\u0101) is a racing arcade game developed by Konami and released in December 1984.
