But you only had one problem : you had nothing to shoot at and flying you out of earth's orbit was too expensive thanks to budget cuts. The government just won't waste money on a grunt. So your job consisted mainly in preparing holographic PowerVertex presentations for higher ups who never gave you any credit for your work. So you quit, hoping your mad skills in PowerVertex will be sought after.\n\nThen one day, a recruiter from the private company \"S\" bumped into you on the street and asked you if you were a space marine. \"I quit\" you said. \"We have a job just for you! Just sign here right now and we will even give you some icecream!\" he said.\n\"Alright\" you said.\nAfter all, everybody knows Company \"S\", who created a machine so powerful that it allowed space travel accross different solar systems.\nWhat could go wrong anyway?\nYou might put these skills from space marine boot camp into use and you would get icecream on top of that!\n\nNext thing you know you wake up in a prison cell inside a spaceship, the VERTEX RIDER, bound for the Colony.\n\"Damn! I came here to kick ass and eat icecream. And I'm all out of icecream!\".\n25 years later, still no icecream in sight and you are still stuck in that tiny cell.\nAs you wonder if the icecream was just a lie, you hear several explosions and terrified screams all around you, with people mindlessly killing each others as the VERTEX RIDER crashes down toward the Colony's athmosphere.\n\"Damn, those zombies are gonna pay for shooting up my ride!\".\nAs the ship's AI open the cells for the evacuation protocol, you stab to death a zombified guard while smiling and say : \"I'm in hell and I'm its slave. I am the HELLSLAVE!\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hellslave-project-z-treme", "videos": [{"id": 131380, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JPYEiDwZbRc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPYEiDwZbRc", "title": "(Saturn homebrew) HELLSLAVE : Project Z-Treme - SAGE 2020 shareware preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JPYEiDwZbRc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 131381, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pwZMdTvtVm4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZMdTvtVm4", "title": "HELLSLAVE - Sage 2020 Trailer (Real Sega Saturn Hardware)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pwZMdTvtVm4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
