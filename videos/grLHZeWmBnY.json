You are Captain Marko Ramius, commander of the most advanced nuclear submarine ever created - the Red October. In a desperate attempt to defect to the United States, you must evade detection from an onslaught of enemy forces, both underwater and on the surface. Danger comes at you from all sides - even from within. It's destroy or be destroyed! And that's just for starters. Even more perilous missions await you as the Red October takes to the sea against illegal arms, merchants, nuclear terrorists and environmental outlaws. Each mission is an incredible challenge to your skill, reflexes and command abilities. All together, it's the greatest submarine adventure of all time!\"\n\nA fairly short action adventure made up of 9 missions. You take control of the Red October and battle your way through opposing forces using a variety of different weapons at your disposal each one fired from one of the 4 buttons on the joypad. The levels get progressively more difficult as the screen fills with ever constant respawning enemies. The challenge is doing all this in just one life! as you will take damage from enemy fore or colliding with rocks. There are powers to collect which repair and restock ammo.\n\nOccasionally you can go into periscope mode and fire above the surface to destroy on coming enemies for a bonus which can also refill ammo and repair you. I didn't try but I believe this mode can be used with the superscope.\n\nThe game can be completed much quicker by evading enemies til the end with the assistance of limited countermeasures and limited use of Silent Running to evade enemies as well as avoiding the periscope sections, but where is the fun in that!\n\nAt the end of the video I add the death scene from receiving too much damage.\n\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grLHZeWmBnY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grLHZeWmBnY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grLHZeWmBnY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grLHZeWmBnY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grLHZeWmBnY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [634] The Hunt for Red October (US)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nThe Hunt for Red October, developed by Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. and published by Riedel Software Productions, Inc in 1993.\n\n\"THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER Defection Was Just the Beginning!\nThe Hunt Goes On!
