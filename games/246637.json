Three days before the fair closed, a tragic demonstration in the Electro-Spiritualism Exhibit brought something terrible into our world. Word spread that an unknown creature was luring guests down to an 'Evanishment Room' - from which they never returned. The attractions were quickly and quietly closed. Workmen refused to dismantle the exhibits as the fair died around it. Two months later on January 4th of 1894, strange lights were seen coming from the abandoned exhibit hall. Through The VOID, travel back to that same night over a hundred and twenty years ago and the decaying Chicago World's Fair. In groups of four, you will have your choice of six personas (avatars) through which you will discover frights, trials, and adventure around every corner. You will explore, touch and interact with the decaying ruins of the once-hopeful fair. Your goal is simple: explore the abandoned exhibits and don't get caught by the demon - Nicodemus.", "summary": "A collaboration with video game studio Ninja Theory, it is a horror title set shortly after the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where a demon had been unleashed after an accident in an \"Electro-Spiritualism exhibit\". The experience script was written by Tracy Hickman and then designed and directed by Curtis Hickman. Nicodemus is the first VOID experience to feature two truly divergent endings. It is also the VOID's only example todate of the use of transmedia. A short book was created with clues that would help you in the experience. The experience in turn had information that would reveal the outcome of the book.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nicodemus-demon-of-evanishment"}
