As far back as the people of this land can recall there is little in terms of land. The continent of Erdrich is all that has been discovered by seafarers and captains of the seas\u2026\n\n\u201cHow can this be? Is it truly possible that the world be so small?\u201d\n\nUnknown to the people of the current era, Araginol had once consisted of several islands and continents. Through the power of the demon lord, the islands that occupied Araginol fell one by one, eventually leaving no remnant of their passing.\n\nJust when it seems Erdrich has been spared from this tragedy, several unfortunate events begin to plague the land. It is up to you, the hero, to traverse the rifts of time and save the world from evil\u2019s vile clutches!", "summary": "Dragon Quest: Legacy of the Lost is a fangame highly inspired by Dragon Warrior 7.
