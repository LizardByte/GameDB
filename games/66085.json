The storyline follows Tristan, a side character from March of the Black Queen, as he seeks to reclaim his kingdom from the control of the Black Knight Baldr. During the story's opening act, Tristan first organises an army of volunteers and pushes back bandits who have overtaken his land. During the second act, Tristan concentrates his efforts on Jenga, leader of the bandits. Depending in the route taken after the third act's opening battle, Tristan either liberates the prisoners of Sikto Prison, or proceeds straight to Baldr's forward base of Megaholten. Tristan's alignment to law or chaos is determined by the player's choice of routes, as well as their answers to a series of questions asked by Baldr. Following the dispersal of the volunteer army and depending on previous choices, Tristan either flees alone to divert the Empire's attention from his allies, remain in Zenobia to rebuild, or marches with chosen companions to topple the Empire.", "summary": "\"Ogre Battle Gaiden: Prince of Zenobia\" is a 2000 real-time tactical role-playing game developed and published by SNK for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
