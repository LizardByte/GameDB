No controls, no barriers to fun. Just move your body in front of the camera to control the gameplay. DanceWall Remix is an experience enjoyed by anyone, young and old, that will have players off the couch and moving throughout the room to control all the in-game action.\n\nIn DanceWall Remix, players make physical body poses that transform their onscreen avatars to fit through approaching silhouette shapes on screen. The goal is to earn the highest score by making the best possible fit with these onscreen silhouettes, picking up bonuses, and avoiding obstacles. The physical gameplay is immediately intuitive and does not require any previous experience with video games to quickly enjoy the fun.\n\nDanceWall Remix is divided into three themes, Disco, Classic, and Retro. Each theme has a distinct look and style of play based on the music. Retro is an 8Bit inspired synthetic world of Electronic music. Classic is a \u201cBubblegum-Pop\u201d world where everything is soft and cute, and Disco is thematic of a 70\u2019s nightclub.\n\nEach level supports three modes of play: single player, 2 player cooperative and 2 player versus.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dancewall-remix"}
