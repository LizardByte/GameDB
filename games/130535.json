The player chooses menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) that are displayed under a still picture that represents the location. Most of these command have their own context-dependent sub-menus, i.e. it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to look at different things and talk about different topics. There are no puzzles, and the story usually advances when the player has triggered a necessary conversation or event.\n\nA business man in Peru and a girl visiting Japan both suddenly fall victim to a strange disease that turns the skin green and partially disfigures the face.
