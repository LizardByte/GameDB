Bags - or Cornhole, as it's called in some places - originated in the Midwest in the 1960s and has since become a staple at outdoor social events from coast to coast. Whether at a tailgate party or a summer barbecue, the game has become a social focal point, and the unmistakable thud of bags hitting the box is now a universal party soundtrack."}
