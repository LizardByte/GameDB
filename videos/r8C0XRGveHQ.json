Create your own spells (programs) to solve open-ended puzzles while developing your problem solving abilities. Draw from your hand of magic cards to solve an assortment of magical puzzles.\n\nThe game teaches basic programming concepts, as well as common algorithms(reusable problem solving techniques) and data-structures (ways to manage combinations of data).\n\nTest your newfound spellcrafting abilities on a variety of fun puzzles including:\n\n- Unlocking doors\n- Transforming objects\n- Levitation spells\n- And more!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQ) I've never programmed before. Will this be too hard for me?\nA) You don't need to know anything before getting started :) The levels start from the complete basics, and slowly work up to new ideas.\n\nQ) Does this cover every programming language?\nA) The programming system used in the game focuses on general problem solving techniques, rather than a specific programming language. After playing through the game you should be able to easily apply your new abilities to most programming languages, including Javascript / Python / Ruby and more.\n\nQ) I like puzzles but I dont want to program. Will I enjoy this game?\nA) If I didn't tell you it was a programming game, you might not even notice ;) Programming is really just problem solving, and I think I've made the experience pretty fun. Feel free to try the demo and see what you think.\n\n#gametrailers #gameplay #learnprogramming #programming #lisp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8C0XRGveHQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8C0XRGveHQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8C0XRGveHQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8C0XRGveHQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8C0XRGveHQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lambda Spellcrafting Academy - Launch Trailer", "description": "Learn to program by creating spells and solving puzzles in this friendly game on Steam!\n\nLaunching Aug 09 2024\nAdd to your wishlist so you don't miss the launch: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2323860/Lambda_Spellcrafting_Academy/\n\nLambda Spellcrafting Academy is a magic themed puzzle / programming game that can teach anyone to program.
