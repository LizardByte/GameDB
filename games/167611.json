Shortly after their arrival, Alice mysteriously disappears.\n\nAlan finds pages of a thriller novel he does not remember writing, with events from the manuscript coming to life. He faces supernatural entities called the \"Taken,\" who are controlled by darkness. The remastered version features enhanced graphics and improved performance, but the gameplay and storyline remain consistent with the original, focusing on themes of reality, fiction, and the power of the written word.\n\nIt also includes the two story DLCs \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alan-wake-remastered", "videos": [{"id": 54553, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mRVBZC-RJF0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRVBZC-RJF0", "title": "Alan Wake Remastered - PlayStation Showcase 2021: Announce Trailer | PS5, PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mRVBZC-RJF0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 511, "name": "Alan Wake"}]}
