Take your place among the gods with the superpowers you've stolen from them.\n\n\"VERSUS: The Deathscapes\" is a thrilling 200,000-word interactive novel by Zachary Sergi, author of our best-selling \"Heroes Rise\" series. Your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.\n\nAt the start of the VERSUS Trilogy, an unknown power imprisoned you on planet Versus, forcing you and dozens of other prisoners to vote for who will fight in deadly gladiatorial battles. Each prisoner has unique superpowers, but you started with just a single power: the ability to steal powers from others and absorb their memories.\n\nNow, with the powers you've stolen, you can rival the gods themselves! You've stolen their power to fly, to fire beams of golden energy, and to dominate the minds of others. But you can't stop there. To find Dhanthik, the hidden savior of your homeworld, you must use your Full Absorb power on nearly every prisoner, unlocking powers and memories beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nAt the same time, you\u2019ll play the most dangerous political game of your life, outmaneuvering your longtime foes Empress Vaccus and the Bominate-and maybe even your own friends-to survive the Versus Vote.\n\nEngage in the most intense MemoryTravel yet, voyaging to distant planets and to the deepest hearts of those closest to you, and finally answering the questions that have haunted you: Who is Dhanthik? Who brought you here to Versus, and why? Who are you?\n\nThis isn't just the end of the Trilogy.
