Super Fighter Team acquired full copyright to this game and released it worldwide in 2015. \n \nCascade is a dice-based puzzler set in outer space, where your skill will be judged by wacky aliens. The best of them have invested weeks of meticulous programming into the creation of mind-boggling puzzles meant to disgrace you in front of their mutants friends. And they'll be constantly at their console, updating the code on the fly to compensete for your skill! \n \nThis challenging game will amuse you with its quirky aliens that welcome you with silly spoken lines such as, Oh no, a human! and May the dice be with you. It also features a competetive two player mode. \n \nHey! It takes cunning and quick thinking to blast through each successive level of Cascade! Complete all seven levels and you will be welcomed to the planet Cascadia. But what awaits you there: Fame? Fortune? The game's production credits? Only one way to find out...", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cascade--1"}
