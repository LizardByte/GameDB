Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.\n\nTaking off and landing however, also requires additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try not to run over him...yet).\n\nYour weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).\n\nAfter each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dan-kitchens-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 64481, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Hh8IBEnwYeA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh8IBEnwYeA", "title": "Tomcat F-14 Fighter Simulator Atari 2600 Gameplay - The No Swear Gamer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hh8IBEnwYeA/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 64482, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5J0kki6UaK0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J0kki6UaK0", "title": "Tomcat F-14 Fighter Simulator Atari 7800 Gameplay - The No Swear Gamer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5J0kki6UaK0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
