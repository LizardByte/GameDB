A very simple but effective game, this game was moderately entertaining on a regular Game Boy, but it was upgraded in several ways with the SGB. Besides the nice custom border and color pallette, this game had a few rare added features such as custom explosion sounds and a multiplayer mode which allowed for simultaneous gameplay between opponents. This means unlike most SGB games which did not recognize a second player controller, this game does, as well as a multi-tap so four people can play! This game has a much faster pace than some of the older Bomberman games, which adds to the fun.
