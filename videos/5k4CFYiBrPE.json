THIS GAME MAY CAUSE EYESTRAIN AND POSSIBLY BLINDNESS.\n\nCompleted using infinite energy and high jumps. I wouldn't try it without and risk seizures/brain damage/stroke, etc... \n\nWell, what do I say about this? It's an \"environmentally-friendly\" game that looks like it was made by a bunch of spaced-out people on magic mushrooms while being inspired by Rainbow Islands.\n\nInitially, it starts off as a bit of mindless fun, if you can figure out what is what from the total clusterf*** graphics.\n\nWhat I could make out is that you're this little guy who looks like a doll. You have to climb the ledges up to the very top to complete the level while shooting pretty much anything that moves.\n\nOne touch by any of these things will knock you down a couple of ledges. Some can't be killed, like the acid droplets, skulls, and killer whales. Stationary things like the telephones and what looks like the pod out of 2001: A Space Odyssey can knock you down also but can be shot to give you higher jumps or better weapons. If you shoot the blue flowers, they expand and create moving platforms to help you up.\n\nSome killed baddies leave a heart which changes colour. Collect these to fill in your hearts in the status panel. When you have all of them... I don't know, I think you get an extra life or something. Don't get the grey one at the end of the colour-shift or you lose them all.\n\nThis was voted one of the worse games on LemonAmiga, though I've seen much worse, as some heart seems to have gone into it, in spite of how all-over-the-place it is.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k4CFYiBrPE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k4CFYiBrPE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k4CFYiBrPE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k4CFYiBrPE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay: Top Banana", "description": "WARNING!
