{"id": "6G0srmSdvJc", "snippet": {"title": "Rainbow Six Vegas - Terrorist Hunt - Border Town", "description": "A demonstration of a Rainbow Six Vegas terrorist hunt on the map \"Border Town\". The skill setting is \"realistic\", with a high enemy density. This is the PC version of the game, in case you didn't notice from watching the video. I created this with the HD feature in mind, and I recommend you view it as such because the normal quality is very poor (however, if you watch it at high quality without HD, it still looks pretty good).\n\nMy system managed to run the level and record with Fraps at around 85 frames per second (just because it was smoothest for my refresh rate), and there hasn't been much stuttering at all. Unfortunately, I couldn't handle anti-aliasing on top of this, which would better complement the HD feature.\n\nThis is NOT meant to be an amazing show of skills, so add any \"you're crap\" comments as you please, if it makes you feel better. This was more a project for me to see how well I could record the game at a 1280x720 resolution and to try out the YouTube HD feature, so I thought I'd share the result. If you search for similar videos, you will see several people on here have completed Border Town on realistic and high density, and I find it one of the easiest terrorist hunt levels on the game.\n\nAlso note that this is NOT a speed run attempt. I don't know if people even do speed runs of terrorist hunts. However, this is the fastest time I recall completing the level in (with these settings), at 3:48, and the terrorists just seemed to come my way. This strategy usually works out fairly fast for me, but perhaps there are directions to take that are even faster.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy the video, and for anyone who hasn't played Rainbow Six Vegas, the terrorist hunt mode is one of the best things about the game (split screen on the Xbox is extremely fun, I should add). Whilst spawning locations of terrorists are often similar, the amount you get at each area differs, and you can get some nasty surprises sometimes, so don't think it's just a plain routine as may appear in this video.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6G0srmSdvJc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6G0srmSdvJc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6G0srmSdvJc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6G0srmSdvJc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6G0srmSdvJc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rainbow Six Vegas - Terrorist Hunt - Border Town", "description": "A demonstration of a Rainbow Six Vegas terrorist hunt on the map \"Border Town\".
