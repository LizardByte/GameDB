It is the third in the Fenimore Fillmore franchise, after 3 Skulls of the Toltecs and The Westerner.\n\nThe mechanics in the game are quite different from the previous games. The player is thrown into a series of \"levels\" where he (taking part as Fenimore or Rhiannon) will have to solve a few puzzles in order to get to the next level. Also a few action scenes are present in the form of small shooting sequences.\n\nIn this episode, Fenimore and Rhiannon find a dying man in the middle of the desert, who tells them of the whereabouts of a treasure from a recent theft hidden inside a tomb, just before passing out.\n\nJust after that a gang of outlaws lay an ambush on them, kidnapping Rhiannon. Our objective will be not only to rescue the poor girl and getting hold of the treasure, but also to pay vengeance on the villains.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fenimore-fillmores-revenge", "videos": [{"id": 143079, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LgizY2zafBA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgizY2zafBA", "title": "2006 Fenimore Fillmore Revenge", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgizY2zafBA/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 11425, "name": "Fenimore Fillmore"}]}
