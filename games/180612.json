Living beings which fuse with enigmatite gain great powers. Such humans are known as \"unleashed\", while animals and plants are known as \"neoplasm\" (NP). To research the hidden powers behind enigmatite, the island was designated a special area with a school to train the unleashed, called the \"Unleashed Nursery\".\n\nAyumu is a rare male unleashed who has a special ability, \u2018engage\u2019, which boosts the powers of his female partner. However, to activate his power, there must be an exchange of bodily fluids. The school president pairs him up with the most powerful student, Kanae, who always maintained her distance from him. One day, the island was attacked by NPs and in order to defeat them, they activated his \"engage\" ability with a kiss.", "summary": "Material Brave is a 2D Fighting / Action game, similar to Duel Savior", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 59123, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "KcqtqfMW-84", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcqtqfMW-84", "title": "Material Brave Op", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcqtqfMW-84/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 59124, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S3_PLsM3uiI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3_PLsM3uiI", "title": "Material Brave [Reupload]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S3_PLsM3uiI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
