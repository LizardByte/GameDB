It adds several scenarios to the main game, which play mostly like a Japanese-style adventure - the player can choose dialogue options or a location to go to. Those scenarios add more background to the personalities of Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt, the three extra-terrestrial heroines of the game (for example, in one of the scenarios Hikaru's Martian cat escapes from the zoo, and it's the player's job to find him). The PC-FX version of the game also adds an \"omake\" option, where it is possible to view pictures of the girls.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hataraku-shoujo-tekipaki-working-love-fx"}
