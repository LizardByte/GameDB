It was one of the few Spectrum games that were also available in ROM format. It formed part of the \u201cHorace\u201d series, which included \u201cHorace Goes Skiing\u201d and \u201cHorace and the Spiders\u201d and the unpublished \u201cHorace to the Rescue\u201d.\n\nHorace is apurple blob with arms and legs, who wanders around a maze, eating everything and avoiding the park guards, who are out to capture him. He is able to momentarily scare the guards, making them vulnerable, by ringing a bell in the maze. Once Horace is able to escape capture and leave the maze, he moves to the next, more challenging level.\n\n\u201cHungry Horace\u201d was programmed by William Tang, but Alfred Milgrom was responsible for the design of the inimitable Horace an artful creation of character using minimum grid available . Through Melbourne House\u2019s relationship with Sinclair, the \u201cHorace\u201d games would come boxed with the ZX Spectrum, making them often the first games that many people played on their home computers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hungry-horace"}
