I played a demo of this game back in the days, it didn't seem all that bad, even if it got rather awful reviews. Even after playing through the first two levels, I still think it's okay. It's not good, but it's certainly not complete garbage. The car controls were a bit lose, but I actually somewhat enjoyed the action stealth mission stuff.\n\nThe voice acting and the story etc... blah\n\nI know the game is just 6 levels, so I will try to finish this game up in 3 videos or so.\n\nI never had an Action Man figure. I know someone who got an Action Man figure of themselves though. o.O\n\nI did notice near the end of recording this video that there is a counter for how many collectibles I've found in the area I am in, so I probably won't spend as much time making sure I get them all the next time. That's a somewhat neat function if it wasn't so easy to find them all anyways, but I'm not going to complain. I wanna watch all those \"power point\" presentations afterwards, as I assume that's what the power points are for.\n\nBosses:\n0:11:09\n0:41:36\n1:03:26", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mp90a9lQkE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mp90a9lQkE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mp90a9lQkE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mp90a9lQkE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "I Try & Play: Action Man: Operation Extreme (PS1) - Part 1/3", "description": "What can I say?
