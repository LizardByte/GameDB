With 30 officially licensed and lovingly reproduced buses by world-famous brands and manufacturers, players will get the opportunity to set up their own public transport company in the fictional US metropolis \u201cAngel Shores\u201d or the European-inspired city \u201cSeaside Valley\u201d to prove their skills as a bus driver and to lead their company to success \u2013 either in single or multiplayer mode.\n\nIn the cooperative multiplayer mode, up to four players will be able to manage their company, plan their routes, buy new buses for their fleet, and travel together on their own lines as a team.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, Bus Simulator 21 offers a number of new options and freedom: Thanks to the floating day and night cycle, players will be able to create detailed schedules for the individual bus routes and to optimize them individually\u2013 either alone or together with their teammates. While on duty within the city, the bus drivers can freely decide if they want to drive their own bus or if they want to take over the busses of other players or an employed AI driver. Should they decide to simply catch a ride instead, players are of course free to choose whether they simply want to travel as a passenger or get involved in the company's service as a ticket inspector.\n\nBus Simulator 21 will release September 7, 2021, on PC and consoles.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gcput-KC4Uk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gcput-KC4Uk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gcput-KC4Uk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gcput-KC4Uk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gcput-KC4Uk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bus Simulator 21 \u2013 Multiplayer Trailer", "description": "Alongside the single-player campaign, Bus Simulator 21 will bring together up to four players in cooperative multiplayer to plan their routes, buy new buses for their fleet, and travel together on their own lines as a team.
