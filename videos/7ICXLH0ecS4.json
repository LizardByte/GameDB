In the midst of their fierce battle, a giant demon emerged, and opened a portal that swallowed a lone Slayer. Ten years later, and with no memory of the past, that Slayer awakens in Mahoroba Village. Toukiden 2 puts players into the boots of this mysterious Slayer, who is accompanied by a unique cast of compelling characters: Hakase, a professor keen to learn the truth of the world, Tokitsugu, a Machina imbued with a human soul, Gwen, a young British Slayer and master of sword and shield, Benizuki, a kind-hearted fellow considered to be the strongest Slayer in town, and Homura, an ex-thief turned Slayer who wields a chain whip.\n\nThe ever-inventive Professor has constructed a unique device for Slayers which creates a physical manifestation of their thoughts: the Demon Hand. Using this strange apparatus, players can grab onto foes and throw themselves into the air to land blows from above, as well as execute evasive attacks to slam Oni into the ground. Not only is the Demon Hand useful in combat and it also aids in exploration of the game\u2019s vast open landscape, the Otherworld. Areas may be blocked off or out of reach, but using an Oni Smash with the Demon Hand, players can destroy obstacles without ever leaving a trace, and otherwise inaccessible ledges are easily reached with an Oni Grapple.\n\nBesides the beasts that threaten to eliminate humanity, the world of Toukiden 2 is also home to creatures that aid players on their quest. For example, materials for improving weapons and armor can be easily gathered by ordering hardworking Machina out to explore the Otherworld. By upgrading and repairing these robotic partners, Machina are able to bring back rarer and higher quantities of materials to create better equipment at the Blacksmith. In addition, the adorable Tenko companions make their return in Toukiden 2 and can be saved from peril while exploring the Otherworld. Once rescued, Tenko can be cared for, and once a Slayer\u2019s bond with their Tenko is great enough, they can journey together in the Otherworld.\n\nProspective players who preorder Toukiden 2 from Amazon, Best Buy, EB Canada or GameStop will receive the Tenko Costume armor, allowing Slayers to dress up as their fluffy companions, as well as the \u201cSanada Masayuki\u201d, \u201cSanada Noboyuki\u201d, \u201cSarutobi Sasuke\u201d and \u201cChiku Rin In\u201d Mitama to bolster player\u2019s skills and abilities and aid them on their Oni-slaying adventure", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ICXLH0ecS4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ICXLH0ecS4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ICXLH0ecS4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ICXLH0ecS4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ICXLH0ecS4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Toukiden 2 Promotional Trailer 1", "description": "Toukiden 2, the sequel to the popular demon-hunting RPG Toukiden, will launch on March 21, 2017 across America for the PS4, PS Vita & PC via Steam\n\nDuring an event known as the Awakening, when Oni ravaged the world and left it in ruins, a group of Slayers \u2013 defenders of mankind \u2013 set out to defend the city of Yokohama and drive back an attacking force of Oni.
