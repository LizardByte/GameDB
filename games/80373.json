Instead of a horizontal view, you can now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tecmo-super-bowl--2", "collections": [{"id": 9308, "name": "Tecmo Super Bowl"}]}
