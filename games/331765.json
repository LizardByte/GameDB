The game is represented through horse racing; players choose between a white or black horse, which corresponds to their color in the game of Othello. You have the choice of three difficulties, though they all have the same set of opponents and the Medium and Hard difficulties simply start you off at the 2nd and 3rd opponents. When the race starts, the Othello board pops up and you are pitted against an animated CPU opponent. Defeat them to win the race and advance to the next, harder opponent. You only have 10 seconds to make each of your moves; if you run of out of time, the game places your piece for you.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/othello-derby", "videos": [{"id": 140541, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pnZttVk657s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnZttVk657s", "title": "Othello Derby arcade - FULL 1cc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnZttVk657s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
