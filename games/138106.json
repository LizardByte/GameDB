In single player mode you could choose between playing as Baloo or Kit, whereas in two player mode, the first player was Baloo and the second player was Kit. \n \nEach character had his own form of defense, Baloo had a paddle ball with very short range while Kit had a slingshot with very long range. \n \nIt consisted of many stages with three different versions: \n \nAround the World: Strolling through each stage collecting ten or more boxes of cargo to unlock the main exit. \nAirport: The Boss stages where you face Don Karnage and his air pirate henchmen. \nAir Battle: You take to the air with Baloo attacking from the Sea Duck or Kit on his airfoil firing his catapult.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 47198, "name": "Genesis/Mega Drive Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zH5-jQUDWKk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH5-jQUDWKk", "title": "Mega Drive Longplay [422] TaleSpin", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zH5-jQUDWKk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47199, "name": "Game Gear Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZmRR90DCbjI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmRR90DCbjI", "title": "Tale Spin *Game Gear* Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZmRR90DCbjI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
