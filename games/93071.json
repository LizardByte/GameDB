The Uplink chapters were cut during Half-Life's development phase and roughly fit in prior to or during the Lambda Core chapter; they were, however, strongly revised for the demo release. Uplink also includes the same Hazard Course from the full release of Half-Life.\n\nIt was also included on \"Official PlayStation Magazine Disc 57\" as a bonus unlock if you entered a cheat into the PS2 version of Half-Life and swapped the discs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-uplink", "videos": [{"id": 88807, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BD31xc-JbOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD31xc-JbOA", "title": "Half Life Uplink on PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BD31xc-JbOA/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 35, "name": "Half-Life"}]}
