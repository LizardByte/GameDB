Bond is able to rescue Natalya Simonova before being arrested by the Russian army.\n\nBelieving Bond and Simonova to be responsible for the GoldenEye blast, Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin interrogates the two in Saint Petersburg, but is killed by Ourumov, who then abducts Natalya. Bond pursues him to a train and confronts him over his plan for the GoldenEye satellite. Onatopp betrays Ourumov and kills him.
