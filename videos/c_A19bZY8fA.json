Whats starts of as a fun normalish platformer soon turns into repetative as the game varies very little throughout.  The difficulty level is abit insain at times (my fault for playing on hard?)\n\nI get abit lost in parts as I look for all the Symbols and Nuclear weapon parts.  But I do get them all to unlock best ending.  And for all the effort, a 2 screen end.  Probe did a lousy job porting the snes version it seems, pretty much cutting the ending off. \n\n Im sure they could have found a way to have some kind of Deathglider battle without requiring the snes mode 7.  a sideways shoting bit would have been enough.  While the game has its good parts, i was dissapointed in the end and would recommend anyone wanting to play it to play on the snes instead if only for a more complete game.\n\nWhile the music is ok, it doesnt vary much throughout the game and sounds nothing like stargate. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_A19bZY8fA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_A19bZY8fA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_A19bZY8fA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_A19bZY8fA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [205] Stargate", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nI saw the recent Sega16 review of this game and wanted to play it.
