Alongside the features and physics inherent to the Sonic Worlds engine, the game includes:\n\n- Original and highly customized graphics\n- An assortment of brand new zones, each with a unique set of enemies\n- Original tracks and compositions\n- Leaderboards for time attack and scores (to be added in the future)\n\nBecause the game was only recently ported to Sonic Worlds, this demo acts as a short content tease for the project to come.
