The intro was done impromptu and only cost me half an hour. XD\n\nAnd here we are! Complete full fan game of \"Super Mario Bros. Wonderland 1987\" the beta revival of \"Super Mario Wonderland\", my other project. The game is a little more different than what you saw in previous videos! But until the direct starts, you can have fun in advance.\n\nPay attention to the information and about \"temporary download\" here in the video description!\n\n\nNimaginendo Games \"NI\" logo by Edu (Buiu) Alves.\n---\n*Original description*\nThis is the prototype version of the game mixed with the physics of the current version. It contains many differences in the way of playing and the artstyle, which would be inspired by the first Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe story has also undergone changes! In this version, Blue Bowser (for those who don't know, he is Bowser's brother who only appears in the Japanese SMB2) is making a big mess in the Flower Kingdom. He wants to be as mean as Bowser. Next to him is Blue Bowser Jr. and together they try to stop the Mario Brothers from proceeding. The story takes place after the Japanese SMB2 and before SMB3. It's like a game from 1987.\n\nThe soundtrack is much simpler than the current version, as it is made up of several musics that create a \"fantasy world\" atmosphere.\n\nThis version was combined with the source of the real version of \n\"Super Mario Wonderland\" so that it has the same physics and bug fixes, so some assets from the regular version are present in memory, but unused. SteelBill Koopa was not the initial plan! It started as Bowser Jr, and ended up going to Blue Bowser's son. \n\nMario Elephant was not present, but due to the merger of the beta sources with the current one, I had to make the Mario Elephant sprites in the project's initial style. Some levels had to be done in the present day or they would be empty rooms. Wonder Flower now appears at the top of the screen with sparkling music to warn you. Sometimes a shooting star power will appear instead.\n\nThe effects of the Wonder Flowers do not cause a total change in the scenery like in the other version because here the room does not change, only the formation of objects that are not tiles in the game editor. Each world has 4 levels and each castle would be generic \nwith the same miniboss and boss doors.\n\nSome sprites I had to update currently so as not to have leftover sprites that were from Legacy SMB3. \n\nSome of the ideas here will be reused in the current fan game and others in the sequel, if the fan game is successful.\n\n*EPILEPSY ALERT*\n\n*The Download Information* \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1bC5y4OhVJGLJFlqouYRzbghzhyzVL02v/view?usp=drive_link\n\nATTENTION: This is a non-profit work!
