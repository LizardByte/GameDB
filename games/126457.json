I hope you will like it too!\n\nKyodai Mahjongg is a great version of the famous Mahjongg Solitaire (or Shanghai) oriental game. The purpose of the game is to remove all the tiles from a board.

The rules are simple and the game is extremely addictive!\n\nFeatures: 2D and 3D mode, several mini-games, hall of fame, high speed, user-friendly interface, tile highlights, many layouts, several great and relaxing oriental music (especially composed for the game), various backgrounds, sound effects, layout editor, shuffle, restart, undo, hints, multi-lingual (at least 27 translations included), and many more...
