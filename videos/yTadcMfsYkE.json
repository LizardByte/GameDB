Introducing Kyle Keever, an aspiring actor down on his luck.

Joining our hero in his not-so-altruistic quest is Mel the liberal, sarcastic and very left-wing sidekick. See the sights, explore New York city and meet a slew of characters whom you\u2019d probably never want to meet in real life all for the fleeting glory of winning a reality show.\n\nAll three issues of Supreme League of Patriots will be releasing on January 29th for PC, Mac and Linux on Steam, Humble Store and the Phoenix Online Store. Season Passes will be priced at $14.99 with the option to purchase each individual episode for $5.99.
