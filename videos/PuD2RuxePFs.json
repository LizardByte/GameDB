Growing up with the HP books, films and game I would always run around like Harry as a child in my own Hogwarts robes and wand. I'm one of very few HP fans that was there with Harry that experienced the excitement of every book launch, film premiere (invited by Warner Brothers) and video game release! \n\nWith my copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (on July 3 2009) I received from EA an LIMITED EDITION POSTER of the video game cover and before the initial release I was given a DEMO DISC with a code for a bonus Quidditch match in-game! (I was 16 at the time) this was one day before I had attended the U.K. Cast and Crew screening premiere of the film on July 4 2009. The game improves upon many more immersive details and accuracy off of the films with many of the real cast returning to voice their characters from the film and previous game, and improved graphics and a 100% complete and more detailed accurate Hogwarts from notes by J.K.Rowling and Production designer Stuart Craig.\n\nThanks to J.K. Rowling - for noticing me as one of the U.K's biggest Harry Potter fans and for coming up with Harry Potter to begin with, & for sharing her wonderful world with me that has been my place of safety, a refuge when the world didn't understand my autism since the late 90s and early 2000s. Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing me with such an immersive and richly detailed world that lets my imagination run free. \n\n& EA games, Warner Brothers - for providing my childhood at the time with amazingly faithful Harry Potter games from 2001-2011 to the books and films that they are based off of.\n\nThanks to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the rest of the Cast and Crew of Harry Potter & Stephen Fry, who filled my childhood with so much magic growing up with the series during the early 2000s! \n\nTo Stephen Fry, who made me realise that listening to audio books isn't cheating, it's another reading experience.

Rowling\n\nMusic rights to Jeremy Soule/John Williams\n\nMy name is Jordan I'm a madly obsessed HP fan since the beginning of Harry's journey that began in the books (1997) and 2000 with the film adaptations! I'm 26, a PROUD GRYFFINDOR! I've a super power called AUTISM, which has deeply connected me into Jo Rowling's Wizarding World and Harry himself as we're very alike in appearance, personality and mannerisms. I've also have worn circular glasses since I was five years old. I've had the honour of being Noticed by J.K. Rowling ten times! I've created a Harry Potter themed YouTube Channel to bring Jo's Wizarding World that I experienced as a young child to new fans and children alike. From the Harry Potter games that were published by EA from 2001 to 2011 I will playing to show fans (old and new) the magic of these games from my childhood that kept me mesmerised for hours on end with a beautiful score I still find myself humming to after all these years, with a fantastic narration by Stephen Fry! Fry got me into reading audio books in 2000, he helped me with reading and understanding words and literature as a whole even though I used to think it was cheating, it's a whole other reading experience. On my channel I hope to show, unbox and share my entire Harry Potter vintage collection from the late 90s, early 2000s as I have some of the most extremely rare Potter items still sealed from back then with rare film props used in the eight films, and also to do a Harry Potter room tour of my vintage themed bedroom. Back to the Harry Potter games: I have had them all since their original release dates and have 100% them so much over the last 20 years that I'm proud to bring it to a platform where I can show me playing them, collecting all the collectables, and show every secret. Harry Potter has a way of bringing so much light in the darkness so I hope to entertain. I record all the footage myself and have learnt how to edit. I have worked very hard to make these the best and most fluid viewing experience in the short time that I've learnt to.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuD2RuxePFs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuD2RuxePFs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuD2RuxePFs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuD2RuxePFs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuD2RuxePFs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (PS3) - Full Game 100% Walkthrough PART 8 No Commentary", "description": "HBP PS3 100% UPSCALED LONGPLAY! https://youtu.be/8vLPjxIbRyk\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 100% Walkthrough ALL Hogwarts CRESTS & ITEM LOCATIONS!
