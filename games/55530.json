Unfortunately, Yamato didn\u2019t last through the war, and it sank to the bottom of the sea. \nNow, battleship Yamato is completely restored in full scale in VR. It is based on the blueprints and the recollections of the actual crew who are still alive. \nIn this app, you can actually get on Yamato and walk across the deck, climb up the bridge, and go inside the ship. \nSee the Yamato crew taking command. View the explosions of the gun fire from a close distance."}
