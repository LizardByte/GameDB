I\u2019ve received the cd you had sent me and after a cursory glance at the files, I have to say the chances of recovering the software seem promising. There seems to be some data corruption but it\u2019s quite possible it may still run. Now, again, I haven\u2019t really dug too deep into it but it appears that it\u2019s some sort of a simple game. I\u2019ve seen plenty of things labelled as \u201cmap\u201d so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it\u2019s most likely one of those retro shooters. Anyway, gonna go take a nap. Couldn\u2019t really get much sleep last night; had a lot of nightmares, can\u2019t quite remember about what. I\u2019ll keep you updated on my progress.
