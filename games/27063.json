There, the player soon realizes they have no memories, of course and the world in Life Forge is all new to them. From here, the players life is whatever they make it. A Life Forge, if you will.\n\nIn the world of Life Forge there is lots to do and be a part of. Players can become great and powerful heroes or, if they wish, villains and take part in quests, explore dungeons and have PvP battles in arenas. If a player decides they don't want to run around and take part in adventurous deeds then they won't have to. In Life Forge crafting is available as well, so If a player wishes then they can harvest all sorts of goods to create a variety of items. All of which they can either use for themselves or sell to other players. Guild and Player housing are also planned features for the game, giving players another little slice of variety and choices which will make their game play unique.\u200b\n\nFeatures:\n\nMount System\n\nUse mounts to travel faster! Different mounts will travel at different speeds and there will be several to choose from.\n\nCharacter Creation\n\nChoose your characters gender and their hair style. We plan to add new races as well.\n\nDeath and Revive system\n\nWhen your character dies, you will have 60 seconds to either wait and be revived by another player or respawn back at your last check point.\n\n*Note: You can press \"V\" to respawn anytime within that 60 seconds.\n\nCrafting\n\nUse materials to craft item by using recipes! Craft items will generally be better then what you would find at a shop.\n\nCustom Graphics\n\nYou wont find any RPG Maker graphics here!\n\nStamina and Weight system\n\nItems have weight and your character has stamina. The more weight you're carrying the less stamina you will have which will cause your character to move slower. Stamina can be raised through strength and endurance.\n\nBoss Framework\n\nEach boss is created to be unique for a more enjoyable boss battle. Custom programming for each boss is put into the game, so expect a challenge!\n\nThreat System\n\nYour character will gain threat when in battle! Be prepared, enemies will attack the fighter with the most threat first. And, there are taunt skills to increase your threat even more, for those who feel bold anyways.\n\nQuests with Quest log and tracker\n\nKeep track of your quest progress and pin the ones most important! By clicking on the quest while in to quest log, the quest(s) will pinned to the game screen for easy tracking!\n\nTalent System\n\nThere are three different skill trees to apply talent points too, giving players the chance to make their character a unique and fun experience.\n\nAnd of course we have all the basic needs of an ORPG...\nGuilds\nDungeons\nProjectile Weapons\nBlinding Spells\nInvisibility Spells\nSpell Casting and Projectile Enemies\nPaperdolled Items\nZelda-Like Puzzle Systems\nMany other fun features!\n\n~Life Forge dev team: SkywardRiver - Lead Developer and Programming, Zetasis - Lead Developer and Graphics, and Benjo - Programmer.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/life-forge-orpg", "videos": [{"id": 11971, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "CgC0Qa2FVPU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgC0Qa2FVPU", "title": "Life Forge | Official Trailer 2017", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CgC0Qa2FVPU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
