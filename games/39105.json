Suddenly, as the final Stone is removed from the \nCursed Golden Crown a massive Devil from the darkest depths of Hell, is \nunleashed, murders all on board and sinks the ship... with the treasure\". \n \nAfter many years of careful research the position of the pirate ship has been \ntraced and legend speaks of death and evil on board. Do you dare to return to \nthe sunken ship and recover the Seven Jewels which have been scattered around \nthe 40 rooms of the wreck, and replace them in the Crown. Before you recover \nthe jewels you must first prove yourself by replacing each flashing object \nwith the equivalent solid object also hidden around the ship. Only then is a \nflashing jewel revealed which must be replaced by a solid jewel. \n \nHowever, with pirate ghosts guarding the jewels, killer fish and other \nnastiea your task is not an easy one, especially when you are in desperate \nneed of oxygen. \n \nCONTROLS \nJOYSTICK", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-devils-crown--1"}
