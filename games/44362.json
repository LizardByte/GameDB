Your character is that of a drain cleaner where you must navigate through the sewers to clean out the mice and their trail as they navigate. Four mice are typically in the sewer per level and each will make capture difficult and unpredictable. \n \nDuring gameplay there are brief periods of darkness where knowledge of the map design will come in handy to the user. After a brief outage lights are restored and the map can once again be seen. \n \nWho knew sewer cleanup could be so much fun!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rotor-raiders", "videos": [{"id": 23229, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "awTaVHp2nzo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awTaVHp2nzo", "title": "Rotor Raiders - TI-99/4A Home Computer (US) [MESS] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awTaVHp2nzo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
