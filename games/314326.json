It was designed by Bernard De Windt (B.P.R.D) and uses as its music track a MIDI sequence of \"Kashmir\" by Led Zeppelin. Nuts is a massive slaughter map featuring a deliberately outrageous number of enemies, known for slowing down even the most powerful of computers to a crawl upon release. It was created to test the /idgames archive upload function for the author's contemporary work, Equinox, and is now remembered as a quintessential joke WAD. Two years later, it received two sequels, Nuts 2 and Nuts 3.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nuts--4"}
