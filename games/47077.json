It was available in MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh, Amiga, and Apple IIGS versions, as well as a cross-platform CD-ROM version, followed by a re-release on the Apple Computer iOS platform in 2012. Infocom was closed in 1989 by its then-parent company Activision. Still holding the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles, Activision bundled 20 of the most popular into this package. The games included are:\n\nZork I\nZork II\nZork III\nBeyond Zork\nZork Zero\nEnchanter\nSorcerer\nSpellbreaker\nDeadline\nThe Witness\nSuspect\nThe Lurking Horror\nBallyhoo\nInfidel\nMoonmist\nStarcross\nSuspended\nPlanetfall\nStationfall\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nThe package contains all the instructions (bound in one volume) and maps for each game as well as all the InvisiClues, printed normally instead of using \"invisible\" ink. The package also features a launch menu which lets the user select which one of the 20 games they wish to play.\n\nAn additional bonus was the updated version of Hitchhiker's Guide. The game was repackaged using a later version of the Z-machine than the original, and now featured a built-in hint system.\n\nSome significant omissions from the package were the \"feelies\" for which Infocom had become known. The package merely contained photocopies or pictures of these items, such as the sunglasses from Hitchhiker's Guide and the Stellar Patrol ID card from Planetfall.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
