I'm back with Tenchu 2 walkthrough Mission 1 in HD with commentary! I didn't plan on making this gameplay playthrough for awhile, but I was in the mood for more PS1 Tenchu stealthy goodness, so I went ahead with it. This is Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins on the Playstation 1 (PS1, PSX). I recorded this with my HD PVR on my PS3 unlike last time when I recorded Tenchu 1: Stealth Assassins with Fraps on the laptop, so there won't be any worries of lag and such this time round! \n\nTenchu 2: Birth Of The Stealth Assassins is a prequel to the first Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, with Rikimaru and Ayame being teenagers. Plus we get to meet the ever so awesome Tatsumaru! My all time favourite Tenchu character! :D HELL YEAH! The main villain of this game is a woman by the name of Lady Kagami, Leader of the Burning Dawn. We also meet her Four Lords - Byakko, Genbu, Seiryu, and \nSuzaku!\n\nI skipped past the Rikimaru training level because it's no fun to watch and just got right into the actual game :) Have fun, and please comment, like and subscribe if you enjoyed my Tenchu video!\n\nA few things I love about this game compared to Tenchu Stealth Assassins is the deeper storyline this time around. And unlike PS2's Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven all three characters storylines are apart of one story and canon to each other. Meaning to understand the full story of Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins you must complete the game with Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tatsumaru. \n\nNew to this Tenchu game besides new stealth kills, swimming under water etc. is the Mission Editor mode, where you get to create your own levels, place your own enemy ninjas, traps, secret doors, and hell.. even bosses you encounter in Tenchu 2's main story mode. This Mission Editor adds countless hours to Tenchu 2 and is a feature I sorely missed in Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven. Though the Mission Editor is dated today and may not give you the same immersion it is still worth a few hours playing around with. \n\nTenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins is one of the best games on the Playstation 1 and for good reason. If you enjoy late 90's / early 2000 era games than Tenchu 2 is the game for you.\n\nThe Azuma Ninja have served the House of Gohda for countless generations. Now three young ninja, Tatsumaru, Rikimaru and Ayame, must protect Lord Gohda Matsunoshin against a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt and a mysterious ninja group calling themselves the Burning Dawn consisting of their leader, Lady Kagami, Suzaku \"The Red Sparrow\", Genbu \"The Green Turtle\", Seiryu \"The Blue Dragon\", and Byakko \"The White Tiger\", the four Lords of the Burning Dawn. To make matters worse, the recently made leader of the Azuma Ninja Tatsumaru, goes missing during a battle with Lady Kagami. \n\nThe Tenchu series has been asleep for awhile, but Fromsoftware have toyed with the idea of Rikimaru & Ayame returning for another Tenchu game. Sadly, they turned it into Sekiro instead. And while Sekiro is an amazing title, one I love... A true return of the Tenchu series is what I want most. \n\nA Tenchu game in today's age with the detailed level design Fromsoftware are now known for. With their continued streak of great music, bosses, and atmosphere. Tenchu today would be a mind blowing adventure. When Tenchu 2 released, the story had my locked in. Seeing Tatsumaru go through his guilt, Rikimaru become the leader we know him as, and Ayame find her place in the world as a protector of the innocent. That was all on the Playstation 1 in 2000. Now we have advanced so far that giving a budget and talent; a Tenchu return would not only be great for fans who will buy a new title day one, but the company its self would see a big return on investment. Tenchu doesn't need a Sekiro budget. 28 levels split between 3 characters and Tenchu fans are happy. \n\nThe last great Tenchu game was Tenchu Fatal Shadows. A wonderful title. If I had known at the time it was going to be the last fully 3rd person Tenchu, i'd have shown my full support for the series and bought it. Sadly, it was reviewed as a lesser game. One I can see being called DLC to Wrath Of Heaven in today's age, but it truly is worth your time to find, or at least play on emulator. \n\nI'm confident Tenchu will revive someday. And when it does, you can bet i'll be here to play it. Thank you for watching my Tenchu playthrough over everyone else that put their walkthrough up. Come back for Tenchu 5 someday! \n\n#Tenchu2 #PS1 \n\nIf you like my content you can show support by:\n\nSubscribing to my YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AloversGaming\n\nSupporting me on Patreon if you really love my work:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/AloversGaming\n\nFollow me on Twitter to interact and keep up to date:\nhttps://twitter.com/AloversGaming\n\n#tenchu2 #tenchu #tenchuwrathofheaven", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kmql0ckTnls/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kmql0ckTnls/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kmql0ckTnls/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kmql0ckTnls/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kmql0ckTnls/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins Rikimaru Walkthrough PS1 HD Level 1 First Mission Gameplay", "description": "*The Gang of Theives* *Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins Rikimaru Walkthrough Part 1*\n\nTenchu 2 Let's Play / Tenchu 2 Rikimaru Mission 1 / Tenchu 2 Gameplay PS1\n\nHey!
