There are also some action-based segments in the game, including a few combat sequences, situations which require quick movement, and timed events.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jailbreaker", "videos": [{"id": 79070, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "nXnTcEg8-Rg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXnTcEg8-Rg", "title": "Jailbreaker (PSX) OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXnTcEg8-Rg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
