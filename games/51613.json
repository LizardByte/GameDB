What little was left of the mankind colonized Mars, and established a society ruled by powerful corporations. But Mars isn't welcoming place, and a violent storm started to threaten to tear the colonies apart. In a race against time, both the corporation and insurgents will stop at nothing to find the cure and reclaim the Earth. As the virus inevitably spreads through Tharsis colony, the players must fight the mutants, the storm and the odds to find the cure before it's too late.\n\nBy forming an unlikely alliance, a corporate grunt and an insurgent drone with a mind of its own, narrowly escape destruction. During their attempt to evacuate, they realize that the cure exists, but also that the STROL virus has developed an intelligent form, and a deadly plan to infest all of Mars. In a struggle to stop the virus, they discover who is responsible for the spread of the epidemic. And as the odds of survival plummet, the stakes keep going up.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/solstice-chronicles-missing-in-action"}
