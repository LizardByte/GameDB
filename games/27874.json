A point&click game where unique minimalistic art style creates an unforgettable and atmospheric experience. Travel through the surreal and disturbing dreamland where everything depends on your actions. You can't die but you can suffer greatly...\n\nTIP OF THE ICEBERG: The game is designed in the \"action-reaction\" way and there are no obvious choices. Beat the game once and then be curious \"What if I would do it differently\". Sometimes it's something small but from time to time you'll see huge differences. The smallest things can be most rewarding.\n\nDARK, SAD AND DISTURBING WORLD: Visit the place known from the previous chapters of the Bad Dream Series. Encounter well known creatures in their new form, or find the way to erase them from your memory and turn this dream to the peacefull nap.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bad-dream-coma", "videos": [{"id": 83069, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "i0Dy6b25kDQ"}]}
