Cyber links are implanted into each newborn child, marking their host with a unique ID. Cities have turned into monstrous urban centers giving the term urban sprawl a hazardous new meaning.\n\nThis is the world our protagonist, Katrin lives in. She is a recent graduate of the police academy, an excellent student, and an exceptional athlete. On this morning, she wakes up thinking that this day will be just like any other; unaware that her new assignment on the recent terror attacks plaguing the city will place her directly in the path of an evil genius.\n\nCOPS 2170: The Power of Law is a hybrid of RPG and tactical strategy. The central storyline unfolds in the future where the cyberpunk culture and a highly-urban oriented society have populated North America. Players will control Katrin and her team of up to seven police agents attempting to eliminate the criminal element in their metropolis.", "summary": "Cops 2170: The Power of Law is a hybrid of RPG and tactical strategy.
