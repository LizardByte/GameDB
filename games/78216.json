The player navigates through the world of Disney's Aladdin helping Aladdin and his friends on story-based quests. The player encounters characters, creatures and obstacles along the way and must gather up an army of chess pieces and magic items in order to progress. By successfully completing different chess challenges, mini-games, chess puzzles and tutorials, the player grows his chess army, gathers gold and collects magic items. The quests get progressively more difficult and new chess concepts are folded into the storyline. Players do not need any prior chess knowledge to play - the game teaches the rules as players progress."}
