Blackout is a game about choices, every chapter of the game takes place in a different location, and the order in which the chapters take place will change based on your choices. Even more so, the path you take inside each chapter varies greatly, and the effect of your choices could ripple across all chapters, meaning you could have a completely different experience on a new playthrough.", "summary": "A Choose Your Own Adventure inspired by White Wolf\u2019s World of Darkness, Twin Peaks and H.P.
