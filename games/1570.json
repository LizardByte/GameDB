The Rokkaku Group is attempting to sieze control of Tokyo by force and convert it to a totalitarian police state.\n\nThe game initially puts the player in control of YoYo, an aspiring member of the GG's, who has to pass a series of simple tests to join, essentially forming a tutorial for the player. Once this is complete, the player is free to explore Tokyo-to and start the fight against the Rokakku Group and rival gangs as either YoYo, Corn or Gum, and play as up to 21 other unlockable characters throughout the game.", "summary": "Jet Set Radio Future is a video game developed by Smilebit and is the sequel to Jet Set Radio. Similar to the original, it depicts a future Tokyo where freedom of expression is outlawed. The user plays a character in the GG's, a gang of in-line skating graffiti artists who skate around Tokyo covering up rival gangs' graffiti, knocking over Rokkaku police, and dancing to the electric soundtrack. The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay. Though the game is set in the future, its style and content incorporates many aspects of 1980's old school hip hop culture, as well as 1990's J-pop culture.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jet-set-radio-future", "videos": [{"id": 997, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Rf6naKIIuf0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6naKIIuf0", "title": "Jet Set Radio Future Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rf6naKIIuf0/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47243, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0dtTGCzgIHw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dtTGCzgIHw", "title": "Jet Set Radio Future (Xbox) gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0dtTGCzgIHw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
