{"id": "ywqukiVAaqU", "snippet": {"title": "Run 3 - Game Walkthrough (1-50 lvl)", "description": "This small alien will continue on and on in its quest to reach the far corners of the galaxy. See if you still have the skills to run again for the 3rd time here in Run 3. There are 2 modes you can select here; Explore mode and Infinite mode. The main objective in this game is to run inside the corridor and reach the finish line. Once you have reached it, the next level will start quickly. Don't forget to avoid the gaps or else you will fall and die. Collect the power cells in the game so you can buy various power ups and costumes.\n\n```\nOverview:\n\nThe coldness of space doesn\u2019t have to be all black and quiet. It can also be as techno and fun as possible. Run 3 like its previous games have you running in space. It\u2019s not just making you run out of boredom but making you run to have fun. Run and jump in the different levels of obstacles in the game. Just make sure to avoid those pitfalls and find the right angle for you to jump and run on.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nThe game\u2019s visuals are pretty simple but done just right. If you start off with the loading screen, you have the blackness of space getting a lot of stars before it begins. You then have a very starry space and the game begins. The level designs are also pretty simple but they look appealing. The colors of the floors do at least change so that\u2019s comforting. The main character\u2019s design is pretty much simple as you get to have your character which is an alien looking like a cute little tub of grey goop. The game\u2019s music on the other hand is very nice. It has that techno space beat perfect for you while you run the reaches of space. The music also changes on certain level intervals and it\u2019s good to say the least. \n\nGameplay:\n\nYou control this unnamed little alien who goes running for some reason in the annals of space. In the beginning it states that citizens are not allowed to enter the area so we can assume that the little alien is just being mischievous and there are more like him. The game is a free running style game in a third person view. He is constantly running and the only way you can control him is by making him move to the left or right as well as letting him jump. You have to do this so that he will avoid falling down the pitfalls which instantly kills him. There is no need to worry though as our alien friend is immortal and will simply revive at the start of each level. The level transition is also fast as it changes level without any form of indication other than a label saying that you\u2019re already in the next level. One of the interest parts of the game is that it flips the terrain whenever you jump on the wall or side. If you jump on a side of the wall it will then rotate letting you run in the side. There are a random number of sides and pitfalls per level. There can be as little as 4 or even more sides in each level. There are also the grey paths which fall after being stepped on while some fall in unison if even just one part is stepped on. There are also different tools you can unlock for your little alien friend from skating boots to high jumping abilities. Just remember that you still have to run in space for fun and excitement. \n\n\nGame soundtracks can be found here: http://jessevalentinemusic.bandcamp.com/album/run-3-ost", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ywqukiVAaqU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ywqukiVAaqU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ywqukiVAaqU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Run 3 - Game Walkthrough (1-50 lvl)", "description": "This small alien will continue on and on in its quest to reach the far corners of the galaxy.
