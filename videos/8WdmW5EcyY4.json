{"id": "8WdmW5EcyY4", "snippet": {"title": "MTV's Club Dead (DOS) run-through w/ ReV Enhanced Video!", "description": "Speedy walkthrough. Gameplay capped from DOSBox and revitalized, courtesy of the ReV project!\n\nClub Dead is an cyberpunk murder mystery game set at a virtual reality resort called the Alexandria. Featuring Kate Walsh, Nick Offerman, Pat Healy, and Jon Schnepp as The Tooth Fairy.\n\nThis video \"run-through\" is a minimal walkthough played in a brisk fashion with no cutscenes skipped (aside from the title sequence). If you have trouble following the plot, that's normal. Relax. Just soak it all in. Everything will be fine.\n\nTHINGS TO KNOW\n\n- The game was released in 1994 on a single CD-ROM. Not surprisingly, the original video lacks in quality. For an example of the original quality, check out http://youtu.be/w5jH2X_Y2lg\n\n- The resolution of most of the game's video sequences is 160x120. In order to display at 320x240, the game engine displays each pixel in separate channels -- RGB plus black -- which, on modern systems, gives you the feeling of watching a movie through a screen door. To boot, the sequences are played back at a rate around 15 fps.\n\n- My ReV project aims to enhance the game's video sequences solely through post processing. No engine hacking or file tampering. Filtering is applied to all sequences equally. I did not attempt any scene tweaking. I tried to preserve the artistic integrity of the original work as best I could. That being said, a lot of the work I did was experimental and done \"to taste\".\n\n- The majority of work was done in Sony Movie Studio Platinum and VirtualDubMod, and utilized the MSU Smart Deblocking filter (http://compression.ru/video/deblocking/smartdeblocking_en.html). Minor audio filtering was done using GoldWave.\n\n- The sequences contain a lot of visual noise, especially in highly active scenes. I made no attempt at removing poor frames or any other such edits. The most time consuming work I did, beyond crafting and tweaking the filter chain, was set up crops for each played sequence.\n\n- I'll post more of the technical details of ReV at a later date. For now...
