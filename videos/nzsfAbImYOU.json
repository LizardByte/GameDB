The player's task is to find things hidden on the map.\n\nThe story is based on the motifs of Alice in Wonderland, but it presents the struggle with neuroticism in a graphic and symbolic way.\n\nIn the game we will meet characters known from Lewis Carroll's works, such as the Red Queen, the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, Chester the Cat and the Jabberwocky\n\nAlice finds herself beyond the event horizon, from which there seems to be no return. But is there nothing that can be done? Can we help her get out of the abyss? If there's even a glimmer of hope, it's worth a try.\n\nCharacteristic hand-drawn graphics, with a strong symbolic style, complement the overall impression and build the mood of the game world.\n#aliceinwonderland #wonderland #whiterabbit #gaming #newgames #newgames2025", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzsfAbImYOU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzsfAbImYOU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzsfAbImYOU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzsfAbImYOU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzsfAbImYOU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Alice Mesmerizing Episodes of Neurosis -  AMEN Trailer", "description": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/3355430/Alice_Mesmerizing_Episodes_of_Neurosis_AMEN/\n\nAlice Mesmerizing Episodes of Neurosis (AMEN) is a hidden object game.
