Alternatively, you can sit forward\non the edge of your seat and enjoy a stunning display of control and skill at\nthe exhibition match.\n\nSuitable for joystick or keyboard control, you will need to master the\nsubtlety of the drop shot and lob as well as the controlled power of the\nforehand drive and volley as part of your repertoire of shots - which should\ninclude a range of recovery strokes!\n\nHowever, sheer technical compentence is not enough. Strategy and tactics are\nvital aspects of tennis and you must develop your ball sense and awareness of\ncourt positioning or pay the price. Play an adventurous attacking game or\nstay back and wear down your opponent - all the choices are yours, but don't\nlet your concentration slip.\n\nOnce you have mastered the skills and strategy of MATCH POINT, all that\nremains is to take a deep breath and step out onto the Centre court in front\nof the waiting crowd...", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
