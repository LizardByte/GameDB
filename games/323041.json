It is made using the Pok\u00e9mon Emerald disassembly made by the Pret team. This game is focused on refining a game considered a classic while using 20+ years of hindsight to improve the experience. Emerald is a great game with a ton of flaws when you look at the game critically; poor Pok\u00e9mon availability, odd team-building choices, a great story executed poorly, baffling rival decisions, and an Elite Four in dire need of improvement. Despite these flaws, Pok\u00e9mon Emerald has maintained a positive reputation with memorable Pok\u00e9dex additions, fantastic gym leader ace Pok\u00e9mon, abilities, the Battle Frontier, and overall being a large step forward for the series. The Legacy Project aims to improve what makes this game great while improving its flaws.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-emerald-legacy", "videos": [{"id": 133790, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "8HVzLqgfOTw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HVzLqgfOTw", "title": "A First Look at Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Legacy", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HVzLqgfOTw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
