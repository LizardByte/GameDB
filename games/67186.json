Use sword and shuriken attacks against the swarms of enemies, and unlock the secret behind the source of evil.\n\nThe game was at first released exclusively for the Famicom in Japan, but it would come to the rest of the world for the first time in 2013 as part of the 3DS virtual console, as well as for Nintendo Switch Online in 2023.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mysterious-murasame-castle", "collections": [{"id": 6375, "name": "The Mysterious Murasame Castle"}]}
