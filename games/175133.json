You're put in the shoes of the Great Architect, one of the last employed human being. Your job ? Rebuilding monuments from the Great Country\u2019s past to offer some more distraction to the mostly idle Great People.\nIn order to do that, you need to synchronize builder robots by tapping to the beat of the awesome tracks composed specially for the game.\nThis task would be a piece of cake if it was not for the Saboteur, a dangerous criminal bent on preventing your Great Work from being done. You have to fight his legions of robot minions with the tip of your fingers, while keeping up with the rhythm of increasingly difficult music tracks.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beat-workers"}
