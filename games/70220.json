The bear asks the player multiple questions, and comes up with lyrics based on the answers. The song that he composed can then be edited by choosing the lyrics among a selection of phrases. The bear then sings the song in enka, a traditional Japanese type of singing.\n\nSongs may be downloaded from the net, or composed by the player in kana, kanji, and romaji. The composed songs can be shared with friends over the PlayStation 2 Network.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kuma-uta"}
