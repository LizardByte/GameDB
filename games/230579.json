StreetPass Slot Racer involves the player racing up to 10 other players along a selection of courses. As different achievements are gained, the number of courses available increases and \"special\" cars become available. Standard cars are customisable, but none of the special cars are. The game completes when the player beats the world champion (although a faster time is available to play against after this).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slot-car-rivals"}
