As you master its logic, Induction will rewire how you think about cause and effect.\n\nAcross more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.\n\nEach puzzle is crafted to reveal a unique aspect of the game\u2019s elegant yet exacting internal logic, gently guiding you into realising the potential of your powers. Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.\n\nAccompanying Induction\u2019s minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer and radio broadcaster Tim Shiel.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/induction", "videos": [{"id": 52073, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QzzKPvMgtks", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzzKPvMgtks", "title": "Induction | All Platforms Trailer | Out Now", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QzzKPvMgtks/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
