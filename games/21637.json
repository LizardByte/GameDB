You quickly call the crew to the bridge, where Professor De Vries reports that the alien creature found on the planet below has escaped while she was running some tests on it. In the confusion of its escape, several of the lab animals also got away. It is important that the creature be recaptured, and you quickly give orders to search the ship.\n\nA few short hours later your are crawling through the port ventilation shaft, searching. Engineer Benson whipped up some makeshift electric control prods to help recapture thee alien, and you are holding one in front of you as you move slowly forward. The sultry voice of your lieutenant, Rebecca Davis come over your headset.\n\n\"Commander, there are life form readings in your immediate vicinity. Be careful.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Becky. I'll watch out.\"\n\nYou continue cautiously on into a side passage. Then you see the cause of your apprehension - one of the lab cats. Grinning with relief, you pick it up and turn around to leave. Then, silently from behind some pipes, a dark form moves out to block your exit. As you poke at it ineffctually with your prod, your only thought is \"How did it get so BIG?\"\n\nFleet Lieutenant Davis stares blankly at the console as a faint shriek comes over the intercom. One of the lights showing life forms fades slowly to black.", "summary": "Heavily inspired by the sci-fi movie \"Alien\", you task is the capture or the killing of the alien on board your ship or the activation of the self-destruct sequence.
