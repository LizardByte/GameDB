The key to any park is building a large amount and diverse range of rides for the visitors. Players can choose from dozens of roller coaster types and can also build log flumes, carousels, bumper cars, haunted houses, go karts, ferris wheels and swinging ships, among other rides. The player also has the option of building their own roller coaster designs as well as other rides by laying out individual track pieces, choosing the direction, height, and steepness, and adding such elements as zero g rolls, corkscrews, vertical loops, and even on-ride photos, using a tile-based construction system. The intensity and type of rides must be balanced, as visitors' preferences vary significantly from person to person; some prefer exciting rides and have high nausea tolerance levels, while others are just the opposite.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon itself has received two expansion packs: Added Attractions (released in the US as Corkscrew Follies) in 1999, and Loopy Landscapes in 2000. Two special editions were released: RollerCoaster Tycoon Gold/Totally RollerCoaster in 2002, which contained the original game and Corkscrew Follies; and Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe in 2003, which contained the content in Gold plus Loopy Landscapes.\n\nBart.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlMDpOihKac/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlMDpOihKac/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlMDpOihKac/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlMDpOihKac/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlMDpOihKac/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe - Forest Frontiers [HD] (Hasbro Interactive) (1999/2002)", "description": "Chris Sawyer originally wanted to create a sequel to his highly successful Transport Tycoon, but after becoming obsessed with roller coasters, he changed the project into RollerCoaster Tycoon.\n\nThe premise of the game is to complete a series of preset scenarios by successfully building and maintaining theme parks.
