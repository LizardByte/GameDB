Like the first game, the graphics are black and white, the controls are simple and the gameplay is easy to learn. The nonlinear game world allows you to tackle the boss machines in nearly any order, or head straight for Tetron's headquarters if you're skilled enough.\n\nThe \"Normal\" difficulty is about as tough as the first Hero, while \"Hard\" features a different game world and enemy patterns that will tax even the veterans. You can also turn off the map, if you want to draw your own, and the optional language \"Retro\" mimics the interesting English translations of older games.\n\nBeating the game on either difficulty unlocks a bonus screen with additional game modes, maps etc. Getting 100% computers, bosses and exploration will only add dots to the end of your savefile, rather than unlocking more stuff.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hero-core", "videos": [{"id": 35703, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Cu_xdCHdSqg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu_xdCHdSqg", "title": "Hero Core trailer - Remar Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cu_xdCHdSqg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
