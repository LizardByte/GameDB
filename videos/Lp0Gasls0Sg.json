This is Act 2 - Gearbox on the \"Warning! 78rpm\" difficulty (the equivalent of \"Very Hard\" that you unlock after beating the game on any other difficulty).\r\n\r\nI uploaded this movie just to illustrate some gameplay from the game. This is the 2nd level, and not the 1st because it has a boss - Voxel King - and the 1st one does not.\r\n\r\nYou are Zaikman, a guardian of the Collective Unconscious. You move from room to room, fighting enemies. When you destroy everything, you can advance to the next room.\r\nMoving is simple, but attacking isn't. There are beats going along with the music in the center of the screen. You have to press the right buttons at the right time to fire at the nearby enemies. The closer you are to the beat, the more damage you do. it should be noted that you don't have to hit every beat. Actually, in some cases it's just a bad idea, since the beats are going so fast that you won't be able to maneuver good enough, and you'll probably lose your combo and points... not to mention your life.\r\n\r\nYou also have spells that you select before the stage from the list you unlocked. You don't see me firing any spells though. I took a heal, but it turned out I didn't need one. You have other spells, like making yourself big, fast and invincible, increasing your combo count, killing some enemies or their spawn points etc.\r\n\r\nThe game is a bit short, but it's also free! You can get it at http://www.synaesthetegame.com\r\nI recommend playing it on a Joypad. Moving around with the analog, and using L1, R1 and R2 for the beats (just like in Frequency).\r\nIf people will like the video, I may upload more...", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lp0Gasls0Sg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lp0Gasls0Sg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lp0Gasls0Sg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Synaesthete gameplay", "description": "The game is Synaesthete.
