And now he gets to spend the afternoon with his favourite band, Uptempo Maniacs, and get a private performance of their new song.\n\nHe is SO excited! He still can't believe it, even when the limo driver drops him off at the band's mansion.\n\nHe has his autograph book, all ready to get autographs from all 6 of the band members.
