You start with a hand of 64 letters that you go through \"Solitaire\" style. Place each letter on the board or \"Pass\". If you \"Pass\" you can't go back to that letter. Once you spell a word and start transforming it into other words, don't break the word chain! That's a \"Twaddle\" and you'll lose points. There's no time limit and while it helps to know a lot of words, Moxie will more greatly reward those who like to think strategically.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moxie-2"}
