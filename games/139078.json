There is only one problem: there isn\u2019t enough energy in the whole planet to feed this machine.\n\nYou are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that humanity needs. Only a few decades ago, Dyson Spheres were considered a hypothetical, impossible invention \u2013 but now it\u2019s in your hands\u2026 Will you be able to turn a backwater space workshop into a galaxy-wide industrial production empire?\n\nNeutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, gaseous and rocky planets\u2026 There is a big and varied universe out there, waiting for you to gather all its resources.\n\nEvery playthrough will be unique: your universe will be procedurally generated every time you start a new game. There will be different types and distribution of stars, planets and resources. Will you manage to thrive and build your Spheres, no matter what the universe throws at you?", "summary": "As an engineer of Dyson Sphere Program, you will go to an alien galaxy building \u201cDyson Sphere\u201d.
