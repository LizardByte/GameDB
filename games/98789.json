The story focuses on Koyama Kazuki, a young detective employed by Igrasil. An agency that investigates murders that the authorities have deemed unsolvable. While working on several, seemingly unrelated cases, you find clues pointing to the person who killed your parents. Can you stop this new cycle of death before it's too late?\n\nKazuki's partners include the crazy and funny Ishikawa Siblings; Kaoru Moriyama, the daughter of a millionaire and founder of the organization; and Suzumi Misao, the head of the organization.\nWith a delightfully quirky cast, players will form bonds with the main characters while trying to solve the overarching case of the Phantom Killer, a criminal with a perfect track record.\n\nCurrent and Upcoming Features:\nWith around 30 hours playtime and dialogue partially voiced in English, Bloody Chronicles is divided into five action-packed chapters.\nThroughout your pursuit of the Phantom Killer, you must make serveral decisions that determine the novel's outcome. Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki's \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil.\n\nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito. Alongside that, a beach-themed episode that is sure to offer plenty of fan service.\n\nBeyond that Bloody Chronicles Act 2 & 3.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloody-chronicles-act-1-new-cycle-of-death", "videos": [{"id": 35258, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "FhIA48x7S0Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhIA48x7S0Y", "title": "Bloody Chronicles PV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhIA48x7S0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
