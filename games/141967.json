It's the standalone successor to the popular Warcraft III mod, Sheep Tag.\n\nSheep Tag 2 is a team based asymmetric RTS/MOBA hybrid unlike any other game. Sheep Tag 2 is a highly competitive, fast paced, action packed tag game that pits Sheep against Wolves. It's a constant battle for territory as Sheep must survive for a set time, and Wolves must capture all the Sheep within that time. As Sheep you are constantly putting your life at risk to gain the edge over the Wolves, and as Wolves you are thinking of ways to outwit and capture the Sheep. Sheep Tag 2 is so dependent on both teamwork and individual skill level, that each game is a unique chess match, filled with high APM, and cardiac arrest inducing heart rates, that no other game can dream of matching.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sheep-tag-2"}
