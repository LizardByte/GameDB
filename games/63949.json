Then Chibiusa asks the player to help her summon Pegasus with the right color Crystal Carrion, who then explains the gameplay. Pegasus also appears in between lessons to congratulate the player on the day. Every lesson begins when Usagi, Ami, Rei, Makoto or Minako either: call Chibiusa on the phone, send her a letter, or show up in person at the door. In case of special events, all 5 girls appear at the door (Mamoru included). Players can also manually select which Senshi they want to play with.", "summary": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS: Sailor Moon to Hajimete no Eigo for the Playdia", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon-supers-sailor-moon-to-hajimete-no-eigo", "videos": [{"id": 67830, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nK5QZb5CTZs"}]}
