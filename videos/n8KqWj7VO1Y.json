The Viking boats are drifting inland, looking for a convenient place for settlement. One of the greatest and the smartest warrior who was the leader of the expedition was Ragnald. Together with his wife and children as well as travel companions, they were looking for a safe land, rich in water, vegetation, and animals. He was also accompanied by his faithful friend, Raga the wolf. It was supposed to be a peaceful voyage, but the expedition fell into an ambush set by women from the Kingdom of Women. Ruthless warriors captured women and children and killed all men. Almost everyone...\n \nWith the help of Raga, the wounded Ragnald survived, and with little strength left the wolfhound pulled him to the other side of the river. Just before he fainted, he noticed his beloved Tove and children among the captives. When he awoke, his faithful wolf was laying next to him, and apart from the voices of nature, there was no sign of the attackers or the captured women or children.
