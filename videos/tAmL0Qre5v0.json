The intro to the game didnt give me much confidence, and once i was actually thrown into the game i was, lets say, shocked. The movement of my character was just horrible, very stiff and just looked odd. I decided to make my way towards the closest hut/building, where i discovered the game is actually just a puzzle game. Sliding puzzles are not in my favorite list of puzzles, but this game seems to like throwing them at you. I finally found a temple that didnt have a sliding puzzle, i thought i might actually have some platforming action to attend to. Unfortunately i was just moving planks of wood in order to get to each rooms exit. If your watching the video youl notice it ends after the temple mission is complerte. Although i dont think this game has much to offer, it did draw me in, mostly by irritance and refusal of defeat. So i think ill be doing a full playthrough of this soon, keep posted and please join my channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\n\nThe quest for aladdins treasure was Recorded by SHLIMPOLE on a PS2 console", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAmL0Qre5v0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAmL0Qre5v0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAmL0Qre5v0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAmL0Qre5v0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Quest for Aladdin's Treasure PS2 gameplay (Oxygen Games) Playstation 2", "description": "Heres a test run of The quest for Aladdins treasure on the Sony Playstation 2 console.
