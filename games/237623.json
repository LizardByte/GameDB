You collect ingredients and key items to create new ones using the titular tool, then use them to solve puzzles and complete quests. The game has you exploring a world of Americana, from grassy overworlds to many \"dungeons\" like the Ritztown cemetery. Talking to NPCs not only advances your connections with them, but will increase your total health as you earn friendship points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-shaker-summer-adventures"}
