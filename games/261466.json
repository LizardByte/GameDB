The project targets ZDoom 2.8.1 but has also been tested with recent GZDoom versions, especially 4.10.0. As with previous DBKs, the goal here is to use well-established ZDoom features to suggest a hypothetical '90s game engine made up of bits of Doom, Build, Quake, and Hexen. Since our goal is not to push the bleeding edge of modern source ports, effort has been made to keep the set playable on lower-spec machines.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shrine-of-the-silver-cyberprimate"}
