It's made by some of the guys who went on to form Open Corp (the team that made Buzz & Waldog), and that game's DNA is really obviously present in this one - those same sound effects ripped off from Tiny Toon Adventures, a similar aesthetic, etc. In a lot of ways this game is simpler, but in many others it's actually a way more ambitious game, complete with a shop system, minigames, lots of character upgrades, etc. The ROM size is even twice that of Buzz & Waldog!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magic-kid-goo-goo"}
