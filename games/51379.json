Players engage in a futuristic street-hockey style game played out on the interior of an elongated ellipsoid arena. Body-checks (weapons are included) go for blood in this game as players can be gruesomely eliminated from the game, including the option to score with an opponent's dismembered head. Power-ups, speed boosts, ramps, and simple team management (for substitutions) are all part of the experience. Some strategy is required for play, but it's mostly pure action. \n \nThe game also features multiple skill levels, 12 teams (from a US tournament league), and head-to-head network play (IPX and TCP LAN only). \n \nIf you are looking for a 3D version of Speedball, this is as close as it gets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyperblade", "videos": [{"id": 39415, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "si27sMt6qPY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si27sMt6qPY", "title": "Hyper Blade Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/si27sMt6qPY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39416, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0Eip7cN7JiU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Eip7cN7JiU", "title": "HyperBlade PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Eip7cN7JiU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
