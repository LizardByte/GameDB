The game was released by Domark for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and ZX Spectrum in 1988.\n\nDevelopers Elite Systems International Ltd began writing the game without knowing it would ultimately become a James Bond title. The game was swiftly branded with the usual 007 trappings and titled Live And Let Die as publishers Domark spotted the obvious connection with the film's speedboat chase. Elite also released the game Aquablast (the original title) to the market without any Bond branding.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aquablast", "videos": [{"id": 138020, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vrS1hcyNIDs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrS1hcyNIDs", "title": "[c64] Live and Let Die (1988)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrS1hcyNIDs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 138021, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M8Sd3Z3aB1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Sd3Z3aB1A", "title": "Live and Let Die - [Atari ST] Gameplay (1988)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8Sd3Z3aB1A/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 138022, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iVCbH_ui7Gs"}]}
