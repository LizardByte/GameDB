Now the third part of the story begins. I take it pretty easy here and I try not to do too much stuff other than the first story mission and an extra one. I also never meant for this video to be very long since I figured that because of the intro, it would cause the audio to lag a bit, and just like I assumed, it did. In the next video, I'll probably do another story mission, but I might also do some random dungeons with the characters I didn't use much in the last game. So stay tuned for it and if you like this video, feel free to subscribe and Enjoy!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqGnmXfBpoY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqGnmXfBpoY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqGnmXfBpoY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[PS2 Longplay] .hack//OUTBREAK Part 1", "description": "Hey, I said that I'm going to complete the R;1 .hack series and I meant it.
