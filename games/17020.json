The player controls one car and has to drive counter-clockwise, avoiding computer-controlled cars whose sole aim is to produce a head-on collision. The player's car can travel at two speeds, a 'normal' speed which is the same speed as computer-controlled cars, or if the player presses the controller button, his or her car travels at a 'fast' speed double its normal speed. The computer-controlled cars have only one speed. Players change lanes by pushing the controller in the appropriate direction when their car is near one of the gaps in the roadway.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dodge-em", "videos": [{"id": 15467, "name": "VR", "video_id": "d1edvROHa8k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1edvROHa8k", "title": "Classic Game Room HD - DODGE 'EM for Atari 2600 review", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d1edvROHa8k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
