We will travel through different islands, each of them being the oneiric representation of an important event of her past. Happiness, solitude or fear melted with hidden riddles, you will face up dangers and traps and, with Niko, you will confront them with determination, ability and logic.\n\nPlayability intends to be direct and varied. Each island has a setting and mechanic of its own. Puzzles, riddles, platforms, stealth and exploration are the ingredients of the adventure. Prepare to start a journey which you\u2019ll never know what hides ahead. A journey whose paths must be wisely chosen.\n\nChallenges you must face are based on different colors, shapes and sounds. Sometimes you can notice how game mechanics intertwined, being necessary to pay full attention if you want to advance in Niko\u2019s journey.\n\nMusic will evolve along with Niko, from happy and vivid melodies to sad and dark ones, the same way as the journey does. Music and sounds are key elements to stimulate both imagination and mood of the player. Don\u2019t just play, feel the adventure as yours.\n\nThe narrative develops as symbols and little tales deep within the scenario. We must explore it by ourselves to discover every detail of this fascinating adventure, fathoming the mysteries of Niko\u2019s tale.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/niko-through-the-dream", "videos": [{"id": 13547, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rJqI5dX-SWI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJqI5dX-SWI", "title": "Niko: Through The Dream - First Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rJqI5dX-SWI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
