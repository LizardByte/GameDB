In the main character's action part, you have two choices in conversation with other characters, and the ghost story you hear changes depending on which one you choose. The character's likability depends on the choice. If the character's likability is low, the story is forced to end halfway through.\n\nThe ghost stories are told in full voice and read in the text; there are no options in the middle of either. Once you've heard a ghost story, you can play it back in the \"Jitsuwa Kaidan-shuu\" mode. The graphics are live-action and CG.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
