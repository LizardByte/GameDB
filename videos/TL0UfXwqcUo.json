{"id": "TL0UfXwqcUo", "snippet": {"title": "Udongein X (Version 1.0) - Full Playthrough (Normal Difficulty, All P Items)", "description": "New fangame that came out yesterday by Potemki11. It's essentially Megaman (rather, Megaman X, name-wise) but with Touhou.\n\nThe old MegaMari from many years ago is not that good, from what I hear (although I haven't played that one), but this game is actually quite decent, even with me not having played a single Megaman game in my life.\n\nBeing a \"Megaman X\" game, you can jump, wall jump and shoot, and charge your shots like with the Mega Buster. You can also do short dashes that range from as long as you press the button to 1 second. You can also do a dash wall jump, done by pressing dash at the same time you wall jump. This same button is used for focusing in two stages that play like a horizontal shmup. Last but not least, you have \"bombs\", indicated by the number next to your health bar. These are usually drops from enemies, same with health pickups. Pressing the bomb button fires a super-charged shot, and holding the button when having the maximum of three provides a barrier that protects from some hits, or disappears after a short while, I think. I never use bombs in this run, but I use a barrier once, by accident. It was dark in my room and I accidentally hit the bomb button when I meant to hit the dash/focus button...\n\nThere are at least 3 difficulties in this game. Normal is the intended difficulty. Easy makes you take less damage, and spikes are no longer instant kill. Lunatic is unlocked by beating the game once, and I assume you just take even more damage. (As such, this video is not a blind playthrough, I played the game on Easy first.)\n\nThere are P items you can collect in this game, and they serve as \"currency\" to buy upgrades from the shop with. You always get one from every boss, as well as there being a hidden P item in every stage barring the intro and Final 4 stages. Some are more obtuse in their ways to access than others. In this video I collect all of them.\n\nLevel design is pretty decent for the most part. Although there are some negatives. The big fuzzball enemies are way too annoying for their own good. Saki's stage is completely bonkers when you first face it. The wolf spirits are only vulnerable when they're dashing at you. And that part with the collapsing single tile platforms would be fine, if there weren't small fuzzball enemies getting in your way, causing cheap deaths. The first of the Final 4 stages also gets pretty bonkers in the second half with its wall jumps with spikes around. Speaking of which, this game also has an unhealthy obsession with spikes. They're like, everywhere, it feels like the equivalent of something I'd make in Mario Maker 2 years ago. That P item in Yumemi's stage is a war crime on non-Easy difficulty.\nAlso not a fan of Seija's boss fight. This one pink rebound attack she has is difficult enough to dodge on its own, but then she mixes it with other shit like this sudden Mario cape-like attack, or she flips the castle, and puts you in an undodgeable situation. (Undodgeable situations aren't only on that fight though...) Nue's fight is also a bit too overbearing, and this is just on Normal.\n\nWith these complaints out of the way, they still don't make much of the game, and the rest is pretty fun, for even as someone who, again, has never played a Megaman game in my life. Give it a try!\n\nDownload it here: https://potemki11.itch.io/udongein-x\n\n0:00 - Video Start\n0:15 - Intro Stage (Tewi Inaba)\n5:22 - Former Hell (Yuugi Hoshiguma)\n10:24 - Dream World (Doremy Sweet)\n16:03 - Myouren Temple (Nue Houjuu)\n23:46 - Forest of Magic (Yumemi Okazaki) (POTENTIAL EPILEPSY WARNING IN THIS STAGE)\n32:31 - Youkai Mountain (Tenshi Hinanawi)\n37:16 - Bamboo Forest of the Lost (Fujiwara no Mokou)\n44:16 - Shining Needle Castle (Seija Kijin)\n51:15 - Animal Realm (Saki Kurokoma)\n56:34 - Foot of Youkai Mountain (Final 4 - Reimu Hakurei)\n1:01:53 - Kaian Passageway 4 (Final 4 - Junko)\n1:06:52 - Sea of Tranquility (Final 4 - Sagume Kishin)\n1:11:22 - Lunar Capital (Final 4 - Watatsuki no Yorihime)\n1:22:34 - Ending & Staff Roll\n\nMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/Vgm9BeP", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TL0UfXwqcUo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TL0UfXwqcUo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TL0UfXwqcUo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Udongein X (Version 1.0) - Full Playthrough (Normal Difficulty, All P Items)", "description": "New fangame that came out yesterday by Potemki11.
