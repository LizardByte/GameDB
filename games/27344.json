The vast subsurface ocean under the crust is used as a transport route between the colonies and a source of natural resources. In Barotrauma, the player will step into the boots of a recruit on board a submarine traveling in the subsurface ocean. The player\u2019s job is to keep the submarine operational, while carrying out various tasks to earn funds for buying supplies and hiring new crew members. Maintaining and operating the submarine itself isn\u2019t the only challenge, as the ocean is filled with bizarre creatures ranging from harmless small fish to gigantic horrors more than capable of destroying the entire vessel.", "summary": "Barotrauma is a 2D online multiplayer game taking place in a submarine travelling through the icy depths of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.
