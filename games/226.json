Not only will your Sims experience the seasons changing in spring, summer, autumn and winter, but each season will deliver unique benefits, impacting your Sims relationships, mood, skills, careers and more. And be sure to dress your Sims appropriately for the weather - freezing, sunburn and other unexpected weather effects can occur. The Sims 2: Seasons really delivers what the players have been asking for - a unique gaming experience offering new seasonal, outdoor activities that players can engage in. And because each season unfolds differently, spring, summer autumn and winter will look different than the year before, guaranteeing a fresh experience each season. From fishing with Dad on a cool lake to catching fireflies on a warm summer night - these are the great moments in life we remember either from growing up with our parents or growing up with our kids. The gardening system adds another layer of player creativity and nurturing to the game.\n\nThe Sims 2: Seasons allows players to guide their characters through life while watching their world change around them. With such weather effects as snow, thunderstorms, and hailstorms, Sims can sing in the rain or get struck by lightning. Each season comes with a variety of activities, skills, and clothing to prepare each Sim for the elements outside their home. In the Spring, gamers may begin planting their garden and then tend to it during the summer until Fall harvest.\n\nSims can play in the leaves, chase fireflies, and have snowball fights. Sims are affected by the changing of the seasons and can also experience frostbite, a sunburn, and allergies. To combat these unsavory seasonal effects, players can adorn their avatars in earmuffs, gloves, sundresses, winter coats, and raincoats. The Sims 2: Seasons adds six additional careers to follow including journalism, gaming, adventures, law, education, and music. Reward items and skill building objects are included to help Sims gain the necessary skills to advance in their chosen career.", "summary": "Head outdoors for year-round fun with your Sims in The Sims 2: Seasons, the fifth expansion pack for The Sims 2!
