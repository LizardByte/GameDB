This is a game I worked on for the last few years as a solo developer. \n\nIt's a 2D precision platformer set in space in which you play as an astronaut medic. You can jump, double-jump, dash, and use a jetpack. You can also heal people along your journey, which also double as checkpoints.\n\nThere are 18 different planets to explore, each with their own visual and musical theme and game mechanics. \n\nThe art style is pixel art, but the music is high fidelity. I made sure to compose a unique piece of music for almost every one of the 150+ levels in the game.\n\nIt was developed using the Godot game engine.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!\n\nMore info at sevenbluepixels.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMygRTj8CcM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMygRTj8CcM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMygRTj8CcM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMygRTj8CcM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMygRTj8CcM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Last Medic - Official Game Trailer 2", "description": "Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905040/The_Last_Medic\n\nThis is the second official game trailer for my game \"The Last Medic\".
