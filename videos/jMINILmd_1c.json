The DLC was completed while adhering to the rules of my walkthrough of the base game, those being no alarms and no kills. However, I also follow \"Factory Zero\" rules, meaning in addition to that, I cannot use any weapons, explosives, or upgraded augmentations. Energy bars, packs, and jars are allowed however, and I hoard them compulsively throughout while only using three or four. The game was played on PC with maxed graphical settings, FXAA set to high, and on the highest difficulty, \"Give Me Deus Ex.\"\n\nACHIEVEMENT LIST:\n-Good Samaritan: Replace the power supply of the damaged Stasis Pod aboard the Hei Zhen Zhu\n-Never Forget: Find the pod Adam was riding in when Belltower captured him\n-Out of the Frying Pan: Leave the Hei Zhen Zhu and enter Rifleman Bank Station\n-The Learn'd Scholar: Collect the three data storage devices and place them in their corresponding locations in the restricted wing\n-All of the Above: Save both Dr. Kavanagh and Belltower's prisoners from decontamination\n-Back Stage Pass - Return to Quinn's shop before taking on Burke and press a button on the desk in the back, revealing an additional cache of goodies, from which I could not successfully extract an energy jar from without picking up another weapon, so it was lamentably left behind\n-Apex Predator: Perform a takedown on Burke without being detected\n-That Old Adage: Use the CASIE mod on Quinn at the end of the game\n-Factory Zero: Complete The Missing Link with no augs, weapons, or explosives\n-Never Stop Looking: Complete the Missing Link\n\nNOTE: That Old Adage cannot be obtained without breaking Factory Zero, but it is obtained at the end of the game where all challenges presented by it are cleared. You can easily make a quicksave right before the end of a Factory Zero playthrough, complete it, then load up and buy the CASIE mod to get That Old Adage.\n\nPC Specs:\nGIGABYTE GA-78LMT-S2P\nAMD FX-6300 @ 3.6GHz\nWestern Digital Black 500GB (OS/Game Drive)\nWestern Digital Green 500GB (Storage)\nAsus 2GB Radeon R9 270 DirectCU II OC\nAntec 450w PSU\n8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1333 RAM\nLogitech G500 Mouse\nM-Audio Producer USB Mic\nSennheiser HD201S Headphones\nDell E2414Hr 24-inch Monitor (1920x1080)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMINILmd_1c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMINILmd_1c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMINILmd_1c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMINILmd_1c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMINILmd_1c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link [FULL WALKTHROUGH]", "description": "Welcome to my full walkthrough of the DLC for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Missing Link.
