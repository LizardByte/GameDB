I cleaned it up a bit, also, where some spots were out of audio-sync. \n\nPlug in your neurohelmet and strap yourself into a one-hundred ton massive war machine in Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, a mech-driving simulator from Activision (1995)!\n\nBitter combat rages across dozens of worlds throughout the Jade Falcon occupation zone.  Against the backdrop of the Refusal War, you start as a lowly cadet in either Clan Jade Falcon or Clan Wolf as they battle for what may very well decide the future of not just the invading clans, but the entire Inner Sphere. Will you rise from the ranks through tactical prowess and victory in arena-style Trials of Position to become Khan of your clan, or will you simply be another name in the long line of fallen warriors?\n\nMechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat gave its players numerous play options, with 32 missions (16 per side) as well as a nearly-infite number of Trial of Grievance 'instant action' missions to jump straight into combat. Mechwarrior 2 has 15 different pilotable chassis, from the weak yet fast Firemoth, through the iconic Timberwolf, up to the 100-ton Dire Wolf behemoth, and all fully customizable to (nearly) the Battletech rules. It also allows you to bring up to two additional computer-controlled starmates to assist you on your objectives, leading to many possible strategies for each mission.\n\nThis sequel to the fondly-remembered but otherwise unremarkable 1989 game Mechwarrior, Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat can arguably be credited with helping to thrust Battletech, and giant-mech combat games, truly back into the limelight. With controls more similar to that of contemporary flight sims, Mechwarrior 2 successfully melded exciting action with an intricate setting, diverse missions, beautiful front-end graphics, and an attention to detail into one of the best presentations of the late DOS age. Mechwarrior 2 led to one expansion (Ghost Bear's Legacy) and a stand-alone semi-sequel (Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries), and the series still continues, with an all-new game simply entitled Mechwarrior to be released soon. To this day, Mechwarrior 2 is still played in multiplayer by its many fans.\n\nNormal difficulty.\n\nAdd &fmt=18 for high quality.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SV6Lv-McqlY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SV6Lv-McqlY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SV6Lv-McqlY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SV6Lv-McqlY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SV6Lv-McqlY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mechwarrior 2 Playthrough: Clan Wolf (Complete)", "description": "The complete Clan Wolf campaign from the classic sim game Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat.
