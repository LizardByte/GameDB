It follows Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE as they battle the second incarnation of the WWW. A sequel, Mega Man Battle Network 4, was released the following year.\n\nBattle Network 3 is the first game in the series to come in two versions. The original Japanese release started as a standalone game, however a second version titled Rockman EXE 3 BLACK was released a few months later. Like later alternate versions, it replaced and introduced exclusive Battle Chips, chip codes, a boss, a form change, and a number of cosmetic changes. Unlike later games however, the in-game shop stock greatly differs, there are exclusive NaviCustomizer parts, and contains one new boss that doesn\u2019t replace a Navi from the original. Despite releasing later, the same bugs from the original can be found in Black."}
