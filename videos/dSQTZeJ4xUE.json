You can alternate between the two characters at any time during the game and discover their varying abilities. Explore creepy environments such as a haunted house, a dark cemetery, eerie forests, and an abandoned laboratory.

I worked years on Gamefaqs writing walkthroughs. Now I make video guides out of them. I do 100% collectibles runs to show where all of the secrets are. I record all footage all by myself, every single one, and edit them together to remove mistakes, or loading times, to make for the best and most fluid viewing experience possible and help others. My walkthroughs are usually of superior quality, so pick mines! I record in 1080p most of the time, except my older videos which are in 720p. I use HDPVR2 to record. I work the hardest possible to provide you the best gaming help. All games are posted with permission from the owners and some game codes are also often given by the publisher. I mostly use El Gato, Hauppage HDPVR, OBS, XSplit or any other program I need depending on the game to record Thanks for watching my videos! \u2665", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSQTZeJ4xUE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSQTZeJ4xUE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSQTZeJ4xUE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSQTZeJ4xUE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Castleween / Spirits & Spells FULL GAME Walkthrough Longplay (PS2, Gamecube)", "description": "Castleween (Also known as Spirits & Spells) Walkthrough Full Game (Gamecube, PS2) \n Played, recorded and edited by myself for my own channel.
