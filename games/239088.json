Firestorm is set in a reimagining of the Second Tiberium War, with elements taken from the eponymous Firestorm expansion pack and Tiberium Wars. Unlike the traditional C&C mode in the original Renegade and Renegade X, the main game mode of Firestorm is based on the conquest game mode found in large-scale modern military shooters such as Battlefield. Players will be able to construct buildings and expand by conquering outposts scattered throughout the map.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/firestorm--1", "videos": [{"id": 84698, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GL-sKU3wrgY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL-sKU3wrgY", "title": "Firestorm Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GL-sKU3wrgY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
