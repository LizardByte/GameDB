In comparison to other adventures i have played, this one plays blazingly fast! It seems it is a single load entirely and the parser is very responsive. The solution i used seemed to have been written for the Apple IIe, which was the computer it was originally written for. There are at least two \"dead\" endings that i have decided to keep. So basically, there seems to be a time limit based, not only on moves, but by real time passing by. You need to watch your hunger and thirst levels. So the title was an edutainment title really. I have seen the unboxing and it has a chart with pictures of animals etc that you would potentially encounter in the game. Every screen has a unique picture graphic, which is very rare for any word game of the era. There would have been over 100 screens total. This longplay is 99% complete. There seemed to have been a time limit on getting rescued once you first spot the rescue ship. Essentially it is missing one screen that says, you have been saved in \"x\" amount of seasons.
