Whether you prefer to tackle rhythm-driven fitness routines or listen to your favourite tracks while you power through your workout sets, you'll get a combination of both with this title. Fit Music is a unique workout game for Wii where different fitness combinations are explored and tailored to suit your needs. Right at the start you'll undergo a physical analysis, which will let you know your current physical condition and help you set the goals you want to achieve. Fun and easy to play - just follow the on-screen character movements and you're ready to start on the road to fitness!\n\nThe Fit Music routines have been conceived by European fitness champion Patrizia Salviato, a pro coach who will be your in-game instructor. The game features two energetic modes - a fun Fit Dance mode that has you move your body and work out along to the music of 15 international dance hits, as well as a substantial Training mode consisting of a wide variety of dynamic exercise programmes. These are based on your physical condition, as determined by data gathered when first creating your game profile. There are different levels to suit your current fitness condition, and of course the higher the level you do, the harder the workout will be!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fit-music"}
