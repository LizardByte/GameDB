It is a Game Boy and Game Boy Color game that is bundled with the Mod Retro Chromatic.\n\nThe game features modern and retro game settings, as well as the standard modes: marathon, sprint, ultra, and endless.\n\nPlayers can customize various options, including toggling the ghost piece, selecting from two speed curves, toggling the hold function, and choosing between the bag or random pieces. Players can input a 9-digit seed to determine piece sequences, or leave it unset for a random seed every game.\n\nMost mechanics follow standard guideline rules. Both IRS (Initial Rotation System) and IHS (Initial Hold System) are present. However, pieces are rotated on the first frame rather than entering pre-rotated, which means they cannot prevent a block out.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris--41"}
