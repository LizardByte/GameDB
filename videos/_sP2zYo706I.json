{"id": "_sP2zYo706I", "snippet": {"title": "VR On The Go - Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare", "description": "Today on VR on the Go I am taking a look at Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare. As a fan of the Evil Dead movies and the unfortunately canceled Ash Vs Evil Dead TV series I was glad to see this experience show up in the store.\n\nAt it's core Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare plays heavily on fan service allowing players to revisit and explore the iconic cabin where it all started. The main bulk of this experience is a runner game in which Ash needs to run through the forest either evading or dispatching Deadites as he sprints towards the end goal of a boss fight.\n\nThe game section of this experience was pretty easy and gave little in the way of challenge while getting to the end of the forest. The boss fight was definitely harder and took a few tries to complete. Controls were a bit of a pain for me as this game has the locomotion and speed controls assigned to swipes on the track pad vs pressing in on the direction I wanted to go. This locomotion style got frustrating after a while and felt very inaccurate.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of the Evil Dead franchise then this is a no brainier and you will most likely enjoy it for all of the fan service put into this experience. \n\nYou can grab a copy of Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare here:\n\nOculus Go Store: \nhttps://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/1789588554444599/\n\n\n======================================================\nPC #1 Specs:\nI7 7700K\nGTX 1070\n16GB 3200mhz Ripjaws\nMSI Z270 Gaming M7\n\nPC#2 Specs:\ni54670K\nGTX 980ti\n16gb Ripjaws X\nMSI Z87 G45 Mobo\n\n\n======================================================\n\nRunning a channel can get expensive at times so If you liked my content, please consider donating to the channel if for nothing else but to buy me a beer and say thanks \u2588-)\n\nYou can make a donation to the channel by going here:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/vrgamerdude\n\nYou can also support me on Patreon here: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/vrgamerdude\n\n======================================================\n\nFollow Me on these sites:\n\nWebsite: http://www.vrspies.com/\n\nVRSpies Forum: http://forum.vrspies.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vrgamerdude\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thevrgamerdude/\n\nReddit: https://en-us.reddit.com/user/vrgamerdude/\n\nLinkdin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hopperdon/\n\n======================================================\n\nFor business inquiries please feel free to contact me at:\nvrgamerdude@gmail.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_sP2zYo706I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_sP2zYo706I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_sP2zYo706I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_sP2zYo706I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_sP2zYo706I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "VR On The Go - Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare", "description": "Today on VR on the Go I am taking a look at Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare.
