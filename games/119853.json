Full, 360-degree spear aim makes PokeyPoke a uniquely expressive, satisfying and difficult to master platformer that handles like no other.\n\nNo powerups, no artificial gates, no monsters, no skill trees. Just you, your spear and your environment. The trials are a test of what you have learned and mastered, nothing more.\n\nCollect optional hidden gems by climbing, swinging and bouncing across an intricately hand-crafted island. Challenges lie temptingly around every corner, and then around the corner from that. Tackle the trials at your own pace and carve your own journey through the island.\n\nThe Trials are tough, but they reward courage and perseverance. When you fail you're quickly thrown straight back into the action with instant respawns, armed with one more attempt's worth of knowledge and practice.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokeypoke"}
