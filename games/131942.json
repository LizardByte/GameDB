Or destroy all stars in Star Chain mode. Witch can walk of fly on her broom (by double tapping a direction) and can shoot boomerang like projectiles.

Shooting comets at comets on the ground will make them explode, which can result in a chain of explosions. If there aren't any comets, Witch can spread them out herself.", "summary": "Released in Vol 20, Comet Summoner is an action platformer starring Witch.
