Taiko 13 takes the game to new heights, being the first version to be used in a nationwide (Japan, of course) official Taiko no Tatsujin tournament in April 2010. In terms of new features, again it doesn't introduce many new things, except a slight change in the Children/Folk genre name from Kanji to hiragana.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/taiko-no-tatsujin-13"}
