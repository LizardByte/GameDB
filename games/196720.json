It appears that the registered version (as a separate PAK file) was eventually made available by the author as a free download too, as it can be found on PlanetQuake mirrors alongside the shareware release. It is an unofficial commercial total conversion, whether it was licensed by id Software is unclear.\n\nThe game retailed at $9.99 on their official website.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sword-of-ares-for-quake"}
