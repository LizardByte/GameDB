Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.", "summary": "Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war", "videos": [{"id": 579, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jZkX3LJDeYQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZkX3LJDeYQ", "title": "God of War 1 - Trailer 2 [PS2]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZkX3LJDeYQ/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 2320, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 3884, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zw.jpg"}, "name": "Athena", "species": 5}, {"id": 2142, "name": "Boat Captain"}, {"id": 4996, "name": "Fisherman"}, {"id": 5176, "name": "Oracle of Athena"}, {"id": 5181, "name": "Wife"}, {"id": 5174, "name": "Aphrodite"}, {"id": 5177, "name": "Village Oracle"}, {"id": 5178, "name": "Gravedigger"}, {"id": 5179, "name": "Greek Soldier"}, {"id": 5182, "name": "Town Square Woman"}, {"id": 5175, "name": "Area"}, {"id": 5180, "name": "Undead Soldier"}, {"id": 5183, "name": "Twins"}, {"id": 2134, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3877, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zp.jpg"}, "name": "Kratos", "species": 5}, {"id": 2141, "name": "Poseidon"}, {"id": 2133, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3885, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zx.jpg"}, "name": "Zeus", "species": 5}, {"id": 56, "name": "Narrator"}]}
