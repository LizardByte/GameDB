If this wasn\u2019t enough, the denizens of the southern coastal regions hear rumor of the free men who, once vanquished, have emerged, more organized than before, all with the goal of toppling the Empire. Amidst the stirrings of war, the elves watch a fateful star and recognize it as a portent that will decide the fate of all those who live in Azuregard.\n\nIt is within these tumultumous times that the troubled Templar Marcus Stern encounters Ruffles, an angel stricken with amnesia. Together with the Elven Pathfinder, Sylrianah, reserved but curious to see the world beyond the forest, and Zarum the Lost, a battlemage with his own internal conflicts, they form an unlikely bond. These four heroes must discover their place in a world brought to war by misunderstanding and ignorance, and perhaps ultimately even save it from itself.", "summary": "Project Phoenix is a Japanese RPG combined with a squad-based Real Time Strategy game created by a team of talented Eastern and Western developers and artists who have worked on many blockbuster videogame titles. The team we have brought together has allowed us to fuse together Japanese artistic aesthetics and Western design functionality. As a result, we are better able to draw inspiration from the best of both worlds, bringing a richer, more immersive gameplay experience worthy of JRPG fans like you!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
