Fight foes, gather loot, build your character, and work together to overcome obstacles on your way to the Moonlit Pinnacle.\n\n\nCombat is deliberately similar to tab-target MMORPGs, being based around global cooldowns, effective skill usage, gear effects, and resolving boss mechanics through teamwork.\n\n\nRabbit & Steel isn't an MMO, though; it's a roguelite!\n\n\nStart a run, pick a class, invite your friends and you're raiding in seconds. Anywhere from 1 to 4 rabbits can embark together. If you venture out alone, mechanics that normally require cooperation will be replaced with intense bullet hell attacks.\n\n\nAnd of course, all the playable classes are adorable rabbit girls!\n\nPRESSKIT: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NgJZ97Eovzzkq-MA0KCtkOTidJZqPWFg/view?usp=share_link", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8R_wpdJtrcU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8R_wpdJtrcU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8R_wpdJtrcU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8R_wpdJtrcU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8R_wpdJtrcU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "RABBIT & STEEL Announcement Trailer", "description": "\ud83d\udc07WISHLIST ON STEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132850/Rabbit_and_Steel/\n\n\n\ud83d\udc07JOIN THE DISCORD: https://discord.gg/mns\n\n\nRABBIT & STEEL is a co-op action \"raiding\" roguelite focused around fighting challenging bosses alongside your rabbit-eared friends.
