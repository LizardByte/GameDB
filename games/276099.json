There are only seconds before the nuclear bombs explode. Can you find the portal doors before the bombs explode in maps and unmarked parallel universes? Since all vehicles have different strategic features, you should choose the vehicle you will use very well. In addition, enemy cars will try to prevent you from passing through the portals by causing you to crash. Also, since portals often change places, you should make a good escape plan every time you start the game. Also, realistic car damage and accident physics have been added to the game.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/escape-from-the-nuke", "videos": [{"id": 101332, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AayucXRnfks", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AayucXRnfks", "title": "Escape from the nuke", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AayucXRnfks/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
