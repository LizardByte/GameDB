There are some large and small maps, and each one contains a secret fight, accessible by finding the hidden purple keycard in each level. There are 6 maps by me (7 including the anti-Underhalls map at the end) and 2 secrets maps by Scotty and Insane Gazebo, taking the map 31 and 32 slots respectively. Maps jump from tech gardens and deep caverns to grand neo-gothic architecture and abstract void spaces."}
