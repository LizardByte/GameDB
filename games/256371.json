The game was not officially announced, but its existence was revealed by Jon Burton, co-founder of Traveller's Tales.\n\nThe game would have played similarly to the first, though would have featured stages based on different Mickey Mouse cartoons as well as including new mechanics. It was cancelled by Traveller's Tales in favour of the console version of Toy Story, though an early prototype is known to exist.\n\nFootage of the prototype shows a wild west stage and a ship stage loosely based on the 1934 cartoons, Two-Gun Mickey and Shanghaied, respectively. The latter stage originally featured a scrolling floor and a first-person stage that jokingly used a placeholder HUD to parody Doom - these features would be repurposed for Toy Story.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mickey-mania-2", "videos": [{"id": 93578, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iBEA9KmPw1I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBEA9KmPw1I", "title": "Cancelled Mickey Mania 2 !!!
