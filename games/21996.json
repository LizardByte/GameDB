The game will start off with 40 levels and will be available on Windows, OSX and Linux.\n\nEvery level starts with the player character standing on the start tile. The start tile is perfectly safe-- No, trust me. It's safe. Once you leave the start tile, you have a limited time to reach the treasure before the level crushes you. To complicate things, each level will include a number of obstacles to waste your time and possibly kill you. You can make your own levels! \n\nThis game will make you ragequit and break your computer or become a god-like speedrunner :)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/infinitrap-ohio-jack-and-the-cup-of-eternity", "videos": [{"id": 9214, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xgiHGkGPKQA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgiHGkGPKQA", "title": "Infinitrap First Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xgiHGkGPKQA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
