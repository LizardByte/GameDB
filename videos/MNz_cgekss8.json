At your wedding you're about to seal the deal with a kiss when ninja assassins burst in and ruin everything by stabbing you! In your dying moments, your beloved Toki suddenly becomes a brash blonde named Towa who takes down all the assassins. She uses her secret time magic to return to the past to right what has been wronged and save your marriage, and you come along trapped in the body of her pet dragon, Drake. Through your time travels, you'll cultivate your relationship with both Toki and her mysterious counterpart, Towa, get to know all of her friends, and experience the colorful citizens of the kingdom, all while dealing with the perils of trying to marry a time-traveling fianc\u00e9e! During battle, you'll fight enemies one-on-one as either Toki or Towa, dodging and attacking in real-time to keep your enemies down. This isn't the kind of game where you can just sit back and let your attacks happen -- you'll have to stay on your toes if you want to stay alive! Build up your SP gauge by blasting away with your rifle or getting in close with knife attacks, then unleash the fury of your special skills.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNz_cgekss8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNz_cgekss8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNz_cgekss8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNz_cgekss8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNz_cgekss8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Time and Eternity: Launch Trailer", "description": "In Time and Eternity, you take control of a knight set to marry the red-headed and demure Princess Toki.
