Wekas can be eliminated by either shooting at them or by shaking them off the floor.\n\nPoints are awarded for each block destroyed and for each eliminated Weka. Also, points are given for destroying the passing UFO, for powerup pickups and for each second left after completing the level. An additional life is awarded when 25,000 points are reached and you can earn one more life every additional 50,000 points after that.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wekainvaders", "videos": [{"id": 82810, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7CYXnlWwzUE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CYXnlWwzUE", "title": "Weka Invaders (Sega Master System) Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7CYXnlWwzUE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
