When the field is active, it will absorb bullets around you as well as place a cursor over potential targets. You can then shoot homing lasers at whatever is locked on. Destroying certain enemies will drop blue chips, which gives a lot of points.\n\nThis longplay blows stuff up on Normal difficulty with...I guess a decent score. I DID had thoughts on doing Veteran, but it is difficult (no absorbing shenanigans) and bullet absorbing is main gameplay! I started blowing up on the last stage because lasers are BLEEEEEEEEH!
