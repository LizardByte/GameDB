The bombs also exhibit unique behavior depending on the type chosen.\n\nAs the first danmaku shooting game in the Touhou Project, the Story of Eastern Wonderland introduces many features that are now hallmarks of the series as a whole: relatively small hit boxes, boss characters who are not much larger than the player character however are highly mobile, a power-up system, variable-worth point items, an unlockable Extra Stage, and a semi-complex scoring system. The game also marks the first appearance of Marisa Kirisame, who would become a major character in the series, appearing as often as Reimu Hakurei herself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-fuumaroku-the-story-of-eastern-wonderland", "videos": [{"id": 17066, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "w-9EQTSex1Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-9EQTSex1Q", "title": "Touhou 2: The Story of Eastern Wonderland Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-9EQTSex1Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
