Players are given a task to complete on the level, playing out much like Bomberman, where players must place ninja traps and other items on the field for enemies to run afoul of.\nEnemies in the game have a hit point total, displayed above their heads, and a line of sight grid, shown as yellow squares over the regular terrain. When a player is spotted by a unit, its sight turns to red squares, and it begins to chase the player. After a time, if the player has yet to be reacquired by the enemy, it will return to its original pathfinding."}
