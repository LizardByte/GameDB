In each arena, different surprises and riddles await you... you will have to try to understand how to get out and, above all, how to avoid the traps. Some bricks can be destroyed by the ball, others by your pod. Teleporters allow you to navigate from one zone to another, the ice makes you slide, while mortal robot-pods try to hunt you down and traps try to destroy you...\n\nThis title was delisted from Steam on August 8, 2018", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 52452, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8HN8DdoCGtQ"}, {"id": 52453, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-LcAlDGIXus"}]}
