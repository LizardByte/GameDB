Creating this project, I was inspired by a lot of horror games, studied the pros and cons and decided to build that atmosphere, a game that would play with the player himself, crush, mock and be unpredictable. I made a soundtrack that fully captures the atmosphere of every moment. I just want to put a piece of my soul into this game. The game will ask you questions and give you answers - your job is to see, hear and understand them. Are you connected to the story or are you just an observer?\n\n#horrorgaming #relistic #unrealengine5 #horrorstories #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRtKLNJjypw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRtKLNJjypw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRtKLNJjypw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRtKLNJjypw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRtKLNJjypw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Who Am I: Remedy Teaser Trailer | New Psychological Horror 2024 | Made in Unreal Engine 5", "description": "Who Am I: Remedy Teaser Trailer | New Psychological Horror 2023 | Unreal Engine 5\n\nSteamstore link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721420/Who_am_I_Remedy/\n\nThis trailer shows the actual gameplay.
