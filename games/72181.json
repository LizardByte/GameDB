You can buy and play them separately, but they link into the same main menu - and, if you have bought them all, you get another bonus game for free (it will be unlocked after you've installed the last game).\n\nIn this game, you control a figure on some sort of paddle. Another figure will jump on the other end of the paddle and, if you press space in the right moment, it will be sent back in the air where some gadgets are. These gadgets need to be collected to advance a level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monsters-inc-dot-wreck-room-arcade-monster-tag", "videos": [{"id": 32753, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "dWFE3c9DRIM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWFE3c9DRIM", "title": "Monsters Inc.
