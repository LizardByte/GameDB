Recorded on the 5th of June 2020.\n\nPOPGOES Arcade 2020 Edition Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAbGMEq_eFQ\nPOPGOES Arcade 2020 Edition Game Jolt: https://gamejolt.com/games/pa2020/478668\nDawko's Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dawkosgames\n\nKnown bugs:\n\nGeneral - The attacking sprite for the Corrupt Cat enemy is outdated... In this build he is missing a chin! This is something I sorted out a few weeks ago but for some reason the old version returned for Dawko's demo haha. \n\n3:03 - Dawko moves his selection upwards from the Help/Tips button, but it causes his selection to disappear instead of moving to New Game. He's actually highlighting an invisible \"Continue\" button that we never noticed because it's been so long since we've playtested a build of the game without a save file!\n \n10:00 - Dawko fights a Corrupt Hedgehog and he's given an insane amount of money as a reward. This is a bug exclusive to Dawko's demo due to us removing some spoilery content. You'll notice that no other enemy gives him that much money in the rest of the playthrough.\n\n18:10 - Chica uses her special \"JUMP!\" ability, but it has blue text. This is supposed to be yellow, reflecting her body colour. Most of us on the team have been skipping boss fights to progress (to test bugs in later areas of the game), so we hadn't noticed this!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su724Y9MBWU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su724Y9MBWU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su724Y9MBWU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su724Y9MBWU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su724Y9MBWU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dawko Plays POPGOES Arcade Demo (2020 Edition)", "description": "Full recording of Dawko / DawkosGames playing an exclusive demo of POPGOES Arcade 2020 Edition during his Color of Change charity livestream!
