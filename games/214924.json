Once the effect of the Kaaarot has worn off, another Kaaarot appears, and off they go! Boxes appear regularly on the field: by taking a boxe, the player gets one item out of 4 randomly. Thanks to these items, he can defend himself and/or catch the Kaaarot before the others. The one who eats the most players wins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
