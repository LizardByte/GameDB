{"id": "sVjIea1bKvo", "snippet": {"title": "One of the Greatest Games of All Time - Silly's Goats - Foxhole Game Review", "description": "For those who just skimmed the surface or never actually heard about this game, Foxhole is this massive War game, run by players, that lasts until one side gets the upper hand and is able to carry out a win. Victory is determined by the capture of the majority of standing Victory Towns. And I say standing because players can nuke them. Yeah, Nukes.\n\nFor context, imagine an rts game themed around the first half of the 20th century. You have to build up your areas, deploy your troops, research new tech, eventually unlock better weapons, tanks, variations of said tanks, concrete bunkers and bases, naval power, all the way up to Large Battle Tanks, Massive artillery and nukes, to drive your opponent back and eventually win the war. That's Foxhole, but every little soldier on the battlefield is a player. These players organize themselves in regiments, build bases, help their faction farm resources, produce weapons and ammunition, run big tank companies, artillery teams, sabotage groups, you name it. Even full on production and supply chains from the scrap they farm to the Storm cannon they fire at the enemy. Everything is player made from the bullet you fire from your gun, the truck you use to get to the frontlines, and the massive bases you spawn at when you die. And I mean everything. It\u2019s this massive and extremely immersive world where everyone has their chance to matter to the war effort.\n\nHow about yourself? Do you play foxhole? Are you going to? Do you see other areas for improvement in the game?
