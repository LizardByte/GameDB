Over the millennia, the prophecy that was once synonymous with hope and the assurance of peaceful times has fallen into disbelief and is now only told as a bedtime story for children. However, despite fairies no longer caring about such a story, a fairy named Maeve always believed in the prophecy. One night during the equinox, Maeve witnessed an unbelievable phenomenon. She saw her grandmother's soul being sucked into the forces of darkness and imprisoned in the evil dimension. A small ember ignited within her heart! Maeve now believed more than ever that the prophecy was real and felt the need to do something about it. This was her opportunity to prove to the other fairies that the prophecy was real and that the described evil was making its move. Without hesitation, she ventured into the evil dimension to embark on her own adventure.", "summary": "In this 3D isometric Roguelite, control Maeve and fight against the forces of evil that are emerging from her dimension, possessing beings to take control of her world. In each round, choose the magic of one of the 4 elements, but plan carefully because the seasons influence your attributes. Gather points, collect coins, and get ready because each round is unique and different!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-equinox-winds-of-change"}
