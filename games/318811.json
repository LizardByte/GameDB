As an employee of a mysterious organization your job is to monitor live surveillance camera footage and spot anomalies. Report any changes in the monitored rooms by clicking on the anomaly and selecting the type OR by choosing the right location and type of the anomaly from a menu to fix it. Anomalies appear at random so you never knows what is going to happen next. Too many active and unreported anomalies means death. Goal is to survive the entire night (from 00:00 to 06:00 in game time). You will need sharp eyes and good memory. The game contains psychological horror that mainly comes from making you paranoid about what has changed.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/im-on-observation-duty-7", "videos": [{"id": 128850, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iz4Bjxf8H-M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz4Bjxf8H-M", "title": "I'm on Observation Duty 7 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iz4Bjxf8H-M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
