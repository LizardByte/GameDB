Have you defeated every boss to the point where fighting them just feels rather stale? Are you just plain out tired of the vanilla game? Well the Spirit Mod can fix that right up for you!\n\nThe Spirit Mod is one of the largest mods for Terraria: with more than 1300 items, 8 bosses, and hundreds of enemies, as well as 3 new events and 3 brand new biomes, the mod has a lot to offer! We aim to make the world feel more alive with new ambient events, dozens of music tracks, and new mechanics, including a quest system. Development is always in full swing in our discord. Join us as we continue polishing and adding to our most recent 1.4 update!"}
