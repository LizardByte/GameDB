It is unique in the fact that you shoot no bullets, and are forced to traverse either part of or the whole screen, and travel over every tile in almost every stage. Bombs are gained not through items, but rather by grazing and sweeping more tiles. Point items are gained only through bombs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-soujiki"}
