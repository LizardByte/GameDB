Collect more valuable diamonds as you fly higher, and use them to purchase as many upgrades as you can afford.\nEarn achievements as you reach faster speeds, higher heights, and earn more money. Eventually, you will leave behind your cola-powered jet-boosters in exchange for solar energy, and who knows after that.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
