{"id": "U8S5VSwcNag", "snippet": {"title": "Arcade Longplay [715] Sinistar", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: georgc3\n\nAn all time classic early 80s shump game from Williams. The object of this game is to mine the planetoids to get the crystals since they are needed to super charge your sinibombs. Beware that workers (red enemies) do not mine the planetoids. They wait for you do it so they can steal the crystals from you to build the pieces of the arch nemesis known as Sinsistar (large silver and red face with devil-like horns) as it will chase you down. If you get too close then you are toasted. Workers are not a threat. But the Warriors (blue and octagonal, with a white gun turret in the center) and the Sinistar enemies you should definitely watch for. Warriors' main objective is to destroy and destroy the Sinistar before you even get a chance to get enough crystals to destroy Sinistar.  20 sinibombs are the maximum. If you get more crystals after getting 20 sinibombs, it will be saved for engine warping as you warp to the next zone after destroying Sinistar.  \n\nThis game has 4 zones: Worker, Warrior, Planetoid, and Void.\nWorker has more red enemies than the other levels. Warriors' zone has more warriors than worker zone and same on planetoid and void zone. Planetoid zone has the most planetoids giving plenty of time and abundance of planetoid to mine enough crystals to fill up your maximum sinibombs. Void has the least planetoids and is the hardest of all the zones. For the void zone, it is best to save some sinibombs from the planetoid zone as it has less planetoid to mine crystals. You want get up 20 maximum sinibombs before destroying Sinistar as your ship's ammo has no affect on Sinistar. Only sinibombs can destroy this nemesis. \n\nWhen you first start this game you start at a pre-zone known as level 0. After that you warp to a group of four zones. After you beat the 4 zones, it restarts the beginning of the worker zone then to warrior to planetoid to void zones and back to worker zone endlessly until you run out of lives. The game is endless. After you destroyed Sinistar 127 times the game only repeats planetoids zone endlessly which is it the easiest of all the zones. But I'm not going to waste my time beating it 127 times as it took 4 hours\n\nFor those of you who want to see the game beaten 127 times, you may watch it at this link as it took 4 hours for this to happen.\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnMIBf_zq5U[/url] -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U8S5VSwcNag/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U8S5VSwcNag/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U8S5VSwcNag/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Longplay [715] Sinistar", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: georgc3\n\nAn all time classic early 80s shump game from Williams.
