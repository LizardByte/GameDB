Use your rudder and sail to find the perfect wind in this tropical paradise.\nRace against other players and find out who's the silliest sailor.\nUnlock continuously sillier ships (and shoes) and after a while even ships (and sofas) with multiple sails.\nBehind the silly exterior exists a somewhat (not really) realistic sailing simulation."}
