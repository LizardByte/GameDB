As if that's not enough, the owners of this maze pit you against a friend to see who will escape first. And then the diabolical owners take it one step further and add a cat to the maze mix - forcing you not only to escape first, but escape alive!\n\nIn this Videocart\nMaze: A straight maze run.\nJailbreak: The maze is a grid with hidden passages.\nBlind-man's-bluff: The maze is invisible and no walls can ever be seen.\nTrailblazer: The maze is invisible but the rats leave a trail on their path.\n\nThere are also a few game modes:\nRegular Maze: Two players race each other out of the maze.\nCat and Mouse: The computer controls a cat that chases the mice. There are 4 different speeds for the cat.\nParanoia: Neither mouse can leave the maze until the other one is caught by the cat.\nDouble Paranoia: There's no cat and neither mouse can leave the maze, allowing the players to practice or experiment play modes.\n\nThis preprogrammed cartridge plugs into the console of the Fairchild Video Entertainment System for 52 variations of our TV Maze games. Regular Maze. Every mouse for himself. Cat & Mouse: Mice vs. hungry cat. Paranoia: Nobody out till the cat has lunch. Or Double Paranoia: Nobody out.
