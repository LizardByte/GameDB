You ended this.\n\nYet, here she is.\n\nShe tells you she's recently gotten a hobby -- fortune telling. She offers to give you a tarot reading. The cards are laid out on the table. You're asked to choose. Each one holds a piece of the puzzle: What is this world? What's different about it? Why is she here? Why are you here?\n\nA cursed book. A ritual. A burial in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSooner or later, all cards will be turned. You will know the truth.\n\nTrouble is, it might already be too late...", "summary": "Before you is a set of cards. Every card holds a scene. Every card is a piece of the puzzle. The choice of which ones you flip is yours.\n\nYou will experience the scenes of this tale in a random order.
