Hurtling hazards bombard your path as you guide a living slice of cake along a curving line through space. Cakefoot is an ultra hard, single-button, minimalist avoid 'em up, inspired by classics such as The World's Hardest Game, Geometry Dash, Flappy Bird, Super Hexagon, Kuru Kuru Kururin, and The Cat That Got the Milk. Simple to learn, impossible to master, hold the button to move the cake forward, let go to move back, and the cake will respond with natural physics. If you can navigate the most challenging enemy patterns you've ever seen to the end, you'll be rewarded with -- a new, harder difficulty \ud83d\ude08\n\nAvailable to play free at \ud83d\udcabhttps://cakefoot.dank.game\ud83d\udcab\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 by azuria sky [https://azuria-sky.bandcamp.com/]", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKIrsfYdcMA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKIrsfYdcMA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKIrsfYdcMA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKIrsfYdcMA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKIrsfYdcMA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cakefoot #indiegame #gameplayvideo | Beginning a new quest in this ultra hard #actiongame", "description": "Watch out, this cake is no lie!
