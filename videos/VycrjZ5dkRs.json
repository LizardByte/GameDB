Set in a post-apocalyptic 24th Century where humanity has fled an overpopulated Earth, Zephyr puts players in the seat of a combat pilot fighting for corporate ownership of resources in the Interplanetary Battle Circuit. The game plays similarly to Doom deathmatch: within a time limit, combatants have to shoot down as many enemy ships as possible. Bonus points are awarded for completing laps or shooting down dummy targets. A wide range of corporate sponsors can supply better parts, and various ammo powerups scattered throughout the arena can turn the tide of the match.\n\nThis video shows the introduction and first round. There's an enormous disparity between the quality of the presentation and the gameplay. The commentary and visuals are fantastic, but the actual combat feels incredibly disjointed. Given all the vertical movement, I had trouble even seeing enemy ships, let alone shooting them.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycrjZ5dkRs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycrjZ5dkRs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycrjZ5dkRs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycrjZ5dkRs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VycrjZ5dkRs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zephyr", "description": "Zephyr is a 1994 action-racing shooter by New World Computing, the folks behind the Might and Magic series.
