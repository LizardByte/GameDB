While most of them are in German language and/or were only successful in German speaking territory, there are also a few international hits included. There are no gameplay changes: player(s) sing into a microphone and the game gives points based on the performance. The only basis of assessment is if the correct note is hit with the correct timeing; the sung words or octave does not play into the result.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
