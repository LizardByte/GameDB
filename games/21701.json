The graphics of Budokai 3 HD are similar to those of Dragon Ball Z: W Bakuretsu Impact. Since Kenji Yamamoto's original soundtracks have been accused of plagiarism, both included games have entirely new soundtracks mixed from the soundtracks of Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Dragon Ball: Raging Blast, Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team, and Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi, plus entirely new music and the American Dragon Ball Z theme song from the original game and show. Both games also support the optional original Japanese language track (but in Europe, only Japanese is available for Budokai 1, much like the original release).", "videos": [{"id": 10526, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rlEpm7mDfHM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEpm7mDfHM", "title": "Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD collection - PS3 / X360 - Dragon Ball Z Budokai is back!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlEpm7mDfHM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
