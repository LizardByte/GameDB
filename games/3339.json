First, in addition to clearing lines, one can also form 4x4 large squares of four pieces to form blocks. When a block is created, it turns solid gold or silver, depending on the makeup of the block. Blocks can only be constructed from whole pieces: if any part of a piece has been cleared, then it cannot be used to form a block. When a line that has pieces from a block is cleared, it earns more points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-new-tetris"}
