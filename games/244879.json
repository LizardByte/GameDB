Of the six kingdoms nothing remains but ruins.\n\nMany questions remain unanswered about what happened to the kingdoms and how they disappeared without a trace.\n\nIn recent times, many have ventured into the region in search of answers, but without success.\n\nDespite this, the mystery continues to attract the curiosity of the inhabitants of the neighbouring regions.", "summary": "Explore a region of mystery and danger in Ancient Mind, a modern take on the classic zelda-like top-down action adventure.
