What if that wasn\u2019t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.\nKate Denson\u2019s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.", "summary": "Curtain Call is another new chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map as well as an exclusive item for the new survivor.\n\nCarnivals are places of fun and laughter, of color and light, beacons of happiness in the dark. Make sure not to walk too far from the crowds and music, to be lured by the painted panels and inviting light of that lonely caravan, or you just might find one of your fingers added to the Clown\u2019s collection.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-by-daylight-curtain-call-chapter", "videos": [{"id": 33519, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ztx3Ryo_nY4"}]}
