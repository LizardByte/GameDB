But what could turn a sweet, innocent girl into a bloodthirsty monster? That is the burning question being chased by an anonymous young man who knew both girls and who has undertaken a quest for the truth \u2014 a quest for which he has turned to the public for help. And, wittingly or not, by delving into the mystery yourself, you have taken up that challenge. Can you unravel the mystery simply by sifting through a backup copy of a hard drive, watching found videos, analyzing police documents, and venturing out to the web to fill in the backstory? And more importantly, can you do it before whatever dark force took control of Morgan finds you?", "summary": "Daemon_9 is an experience that defies easy description. In pure gamer terms, it can be called a Full-Motion Video game; and an ARG (Alternate Reality Game). But in reality it is a new storytelling paradigm, part movie, part game, part augmented reality experience.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daemon-9"}
