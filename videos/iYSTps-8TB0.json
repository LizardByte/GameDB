Sidrial was a very ambitious and obscure Total Conversion mod for Quake III Arena by Fountainhead Entertainment Inc. It boasted Machinima cutscenes, a single-player storyline, and a fully-fledged multiplayer arena. With all this going for it, how did Sidrial fall into obscurity while other games like Nexuiz, OpenArena, and Reflex remain well-known among the Quake fandom?\n\nSimple: it's vaporware.\n\nSidrial never got past the tiny demo you see now before you. The storyline was apparently finished in a separate \"Battle Over In Machinimation[1], but I wouldn't know anything more about that. It's really tragic, too, as this is some of the most impressive stuff I've ever seen made for Quake 3. Sidrial feels like an indie throwback along the lines of Ion Maiden, but it's actually a real product from 2002. The jetpack mechanics are really awesome and make Sidrial feel unique among all the other arena FPS titles of the time. I also really dig the two music tracks because they remind me of Alexander Brandon's work on Deus Ex and UT99.\n\nI wish I could show you more of Sidrial, but you only get one life with no saves and I just don't know how to get past the crusher traps without God Mode. The only other video shows an even harder crusher trap that makes me wonder if they even playtested this level:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW47OCY5kr4&t=6m25s\n\n\nHRTF grade:\nA (no vertical HRTF)\n\nSettings:\nWindows Control Panel: Stereo\ncg_fov \"115.63\"\nIRC_1037 HRTF tables placed in %APPDATA%/OpenAL/HRTF\n(in alsoft.ini located in %APPDATA%)\nchannels=stereo\nfrequency=44100\nstereo-mode=headphones\ncf_level=0\nsample-type=float32\nperiods=3\nperiod_size=1024\ndefault-hrtf=irc_1037_44100\nhrtf=true\n\nLinks:\n[1]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEBGREP7M0o\nhttp://openal-soft.org/\nhttps://mega.nz/#!OTpDkQhY!i6NIUTAwopa2pilAiEL-pBxPOzrPLD_vHQMcCRdFLLs\n(download personalized HRTF presets here)\n\n(Use of this logo falls under fair use laws.)\n\n\n\n#3dsound #spatialaudio #binaural #3daudio #360audio #8daudio #hrtf #headphones #audiophile #gameaudio #retrogaming #quake #mod #machinima\n3D 3\u0414 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 3D\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9 \u30d0\u30a4\u30ce\u30fc\u30e9\u30eb \u7a7a\u9593\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa Ilusi\u00f3n Auditiva Sonido 3D \u00e1udio audio espacial Som em 3D 3D zvok Son en 3D 3D geluid 3D zvuk 3d\u58f0\u97f3 \u53cc\u8033 \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07 3D \u00c2m thanh 3D Suono 3D audio spaziale 3d-\u00e4\u00e4ni binauraalisen 3D lyd 3D d\u017awi\u0119k Suara 3D 3D \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc 3 \u0921\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0909\u0902\u0921 3 \u0921\u0940 \u0927\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093f \u0635\u0648\u062a \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062f \u0635\u062f\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u06cc \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 3D ska\u0146a 3D garsai 3D ses \u05e6\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05ea\u05dc\u05ea \u05de\u05de\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "This vaporware Quake III total conversion had some IMPRESSIVE audio! \ud83c\udfa7", "description": "Actual gameplay starts at 0:40 with a short peek at the Deathmatch level at 6:07.
