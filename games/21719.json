SpongeBob SquigglePants puts you in the driver's seat for a dizzying series of lightening-speed Nanogames, giving you mere seconds to finish one before moving right on to the next. Within this rapid-fire succession of challenges, SpongeBob SquigglePants exposes players to never-before-seen SpongeBob art styles from the Nickelodeon vault. SpongeBob SquigglePants also lets players digitally draw, paint, color and choose from dozens of SpongeBob-themed stamps to create a masterpiece worthy of a place in Patchy's own collection of SpongeBob art. The entire game is hosted by SpongeBob's biggest fan, Patchy the Pirate, in a never-before-seen live action experience for an added level of under-the-sea silliness.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spongebob-squigglepants-3d"}
