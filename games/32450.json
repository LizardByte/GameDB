The game at its core is a competitive platformer that\u2019s all about maintaining momentum with skilful navigation. The players compete to be the last robot standing; using a charged burst of speed called the Jolt, and an array of different objects in the environment. Your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the Void, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jolt-super-robot-racer"}
