A very popular genre in Germany even nowadays - but this one has less graphics than the Amiga-classics \"Bundesliga Manager Professional\", \"Anstoss\" or any Managergame else I can remember (on the Amiga).

I just...DIG THEM OUT ! :) This is only Gameplayfootage to give you an overview of the Game (no longplay). It`s simple and it`s short - but if you`re tired of the 50th Videoupload of \"Turrican\", \"The Last Ninja\" or \"R-Type\" in the Retro-Community on YouTube...maybe you`ll find some Games you`ve never seen before...just over here.\n\nPlease keep in mind that YT-Videos are only shown in 25 or 30 frames per second. And there`s always a massive re-encode done (double-trouble-mode: Videoeditor AND YouTube after the upload). So some of these unbelievable smooth running & good looking & awesome sounding Games - with 50 fps or more on NTSC - can`t be shown over here like if you`re playing them for real. No matter if you`re playing them on a real Hardware or an Emulator: the experience with gfx/sound/scrolling will be MUCH better than any YouTube-Video will ever be able to capture.\n\nRate & Subscribe & Whatever (yeah, you know the stuff :)) to keep them coming.
