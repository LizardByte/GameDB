When she hits a home run so hard that it flies into space, it crashes on a faraway planet and creates a crater in the process. Now, the aliens from that planet are invading Earth, and its up to Sally to save the day! Unlike most breakout games, the game isn't over if the ball touches the ground. Instead, the player has to avoid various projectiles shot by enemies. If they get hit, they get a strike, and three strikes means they're out! With plenty of power-ups, 70 exciting levels, 8 bosses, and a full-blown level editor, Aliens Go Home Run is breakout like you've never seen it before.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-go-home-run", "videos": [{"id": 11752, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oJMbLQYYkNg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJMbLQYYkNg", "title": "Aliens Go Home Run! - Trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJMbLQYYkNg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 82743, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "NU5BQKY7208", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU5BQKY7208", "title": "Aliens Go Home Run - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NU5BQKY7208/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
