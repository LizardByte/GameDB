The idea was not to relying on codified narrative theories or formulas - like three-act structures, etc. - but rather assume \"what makes a good story\" cannot be systematized and instead must be arrived at organically via extensive user testing.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-snowfield", "videos": [{"id": 46301, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Rbdb5KP4rwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbdb5KP4rwk", "title": "Snowfield Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rbdb5KP4rwk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
