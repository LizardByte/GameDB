I have never tried to widely disclose them in my maps and wanted to practice. In some places everything turned out as I had planned, in some places very average. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the final result. As an experiment, I added coop-starts, but cooperative was not tested at all. The difficulty is above medium, but you can choose from HMP and UV.\n\nThe map is very long (about one and a half hours), so it will be tiring to go through in single try. The player is faced with the task of finding 6 yellow keys scattered across map locations. The keys must be placed on pedestals in a separate huge room, which can be reached via a teleport in the center of the map (where the hammer is). I think this should help you not to despair if you get lost.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/infraworld-the-hatehammer"}
