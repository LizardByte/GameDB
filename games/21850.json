Intent on making Earth their primary fortress of attack, the Ver'mith quickly eliminated the majority of Earth\u2019s defenses. As the destruction spreads, the once buried fighting instincts within Exelica and Crueltear re-awoke. The final battle against the Ver'mith has begun, but this time the Ver'mith have their own version of a Triggerheart unit known as Faintear.\n\nOutnumbered, but with their fighting instincts awoken, and with a reason to fight once again, the future of planet Earth and the entire galaxy rests on the Triggerheart units.", "summary": "Triggerheart Exelica is a vertically scrolling Japanese arcade shooter with a little bit of everything: fast-paced action, scalable difficulty, massive hordes of enemy Ver'mith, and cute humanoid weapons who can either shoot down enemy ships or capture them to use as shields or projectiles.
