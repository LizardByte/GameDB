It was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1999 as a launch title for the 64DD, for which a soundtrack by Tatsuhiko Asano was released on CD by Media Factory, early the next year. Both of these received positive reviews. An expansion was released five months later called Kyojin no Doshin Kaih\u014d Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daish\u016bgou, which takes a very different perspective of the game, featuring short animated clips that the player can unlock after playing the original game. This is the original Nintendo 64DD release, but the game had an enhanced port with better graphics for the Nintendo GameCube, which was released in Europe under the name \"Doshin the Giant\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 60063, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "R1SJIWEKhUE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1SJIWEKhUE", "title": "[Nintendo 64DD] Kyojin no Doshin 1 First Launch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1SJIWEKhUE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
