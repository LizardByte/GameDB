Players assume the role of a general on a quest to conquer the world one country at a time. Players amass armies either by encountering other players on StreetPass or using Play Coins to recruit mercenaries, before taking on the leaders of each country. Battles follow a rock, paper, scissors mechanic, in which players assign soldiers to three classes, with each have strengths and weaknesses against the other classes, and pit them against the opponent, the first to win two matches winning the battle and earning a portion of their soldiers. Defeating certain leaders earns materials which can be used to upgrade the player's castle, granting new options. Players encountered on StreetPass will be monarchs if they have StreetPass Battle. The player may choose to greet the monarch peacefully or challenge them to a battle in order to earn more soldiers."}
