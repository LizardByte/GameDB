It is based upon Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon sh\u014djo manga and anime series, though its gameplay has been compared with other titles in the same genre such as SNK's Samurai Shodown. Loosely following the third season of the anime series, which adapted the third arc of the manga, the players control either one of the five original Inner Senshi or one of the three Outer Senshi as they enter a tournament to fight against each other and become the winning victor. Takeuchi supervised the production of the project and seiy\u016bs from the anime series returned to reprise their roles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon-s--1"}
