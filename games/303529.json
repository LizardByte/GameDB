Alongside a remake of that handheld was also Modern Chef, a mini-game featuring Peach doing the same: keeping food in the air by flipping it in her frying pan. Though added challenges included aspects of cooking the food, feeding Yoshi, keeping food from burning, etc!\n\nModern Modern Chef is a remake of that remake! Faithfully recreated with completely hand-drawn artwork, playable with both the original gameplay style and a challenging new reaction-based game mode! Also included are several control and accessibility options plus secrets and unlockable extras!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/modern-modern-chef"}
