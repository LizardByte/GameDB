Systems, Hackers and Networks wage war in a matrix of DOOM! The only constraints are time and space; unlike other real time strategy games, no resource economy exists in KP. \n \nAll units are free in this game, every factory built will be spamming units at all times. You can build more factories, but only on pre-defined areas (geothermal vents). All that remains is pure strategy and tactics. \n \nKP makes for a frantically fast-paced, action-oriented game, with a very unique graphical style.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kernel-panic", "videos": [{"id": 22655, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "doF7owZ0blk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doF7owZ0blk", "title": "Kernel Panic 3.1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doF7owZ0blk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
