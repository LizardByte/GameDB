Now it's a whole lot easier to do, thanks to VIRTUA STRIKER 2. Based on the wildly popular Japanese arcade game, you play in an international tournament against world-class football teams. You control your player's actions through long passes, short passes, or side kicks. You can also choose to align your team's offense with the Change Formation command, or try to steal the ball from your opponents or prevent the competition from getting the ball down field with a slide tackle. Play in your choice of Arcade, Versus, or Tournament modes. Use the Power Meter to your advantage when taking a shot on goal. Play against the computer or dominate a friend in Two-Player mode. Featuring breathtaking graphics and a brilliant use of motion capture that gives the players absolutely stunning fluid motion, VIRTUA STRIKER 2 scores a goal in armchair soccer", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/virtua-striker-2", "videos": [{"id": 88315, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mxcBI5mSCmk"}]}
