This time, her wickedness is lurking near the Galactic Corporation's defense fleet aboard her wicked rocket, the Gargantua. Our home-toads are rarin' to rumble against the Queen and her villainous sidekicks, Big Blag and Robo-Manus. But the ever cautions Dark Queen is not taking any chances, and this time she's brought some new reinforcements in the shape of new baddies like General Vermin and Robo Rat!", "summary": "Up to three players, as the Battletoads, brawl aliens and mutant rodents through six levels to save the universe from the Dark Queen. The game also includes vertical and bonus levels. Each Toad has its own signature attack, and as customary for the series, players can knock enemies towards the screen, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nRare took greater liberties with violence and gore in Battletoads Arcade since the product was not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology that was implemented in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well and appeared financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release the game. A port for the Super Nintendo was in production but canceled. The game received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battletoads--1", "videos": [{"id": 48561, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EH40wIgWU-g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH40wIgWU-g", "title": "Arcade Longplay [480] Battletoads", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EH40wIgWU-g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
