There is a big point&click slant. Your companions are spirits you recruit. You can play by the rules or go and destroy those rules.\n\nThe main thing will be exploration of the world and its lore, and interaction with your companions and NPCs you meet. It's a story that deals with freedom, control, exploitation and oppressive power structures.\n\nIf you don't like to grind you won't have to. But if you want, you can go and try to catch them all, and defeat all the optional bosses. There's a New Game+ for those who want even more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
