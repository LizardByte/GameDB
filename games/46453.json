The heart of the game is the career mode where the player has to drive successfully in different races. With the earned price money he can buy new equipment for his car. Besides the usual round courses the game also features off-road races in open terrain where the player has to orientate himself and challenges where every irregularity, e.g. knocking down the course boundaries or breaking for too long, results in a loss of points.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/4x4-hummer"}
