Hostilities between various human factions and aliens were inevitable. In addition to that, a mysterious group known as the VOID started to carry out attacks on civilians. Mercenaries and space explorers, called \"hunters\", formed a treaty of their own, and one of them must face the VOID and bring peace to the galaxy.", "summary": "The Odysseus Project is a follow-up to Star Cruiser. Gameplay concept and visual style are very similar to that of the predecessor: it is a first-person 3D shooter with extensive exploration and customization elements, which grants it a light role-playing angle. Much of the game is spent on planet surfaces, in populated or hostile areas. Combat is action-based by default, but there is an option for a menu-based combat as well. There is a variety of weapons, armor, gadgets, and items to find or purchase. It is also possible to physically navigate a spaceship. Combat in space plays similarly to on-foot battles, with the additional of a freely rotatable camera.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-cruiser-ii-the-odysseus-project"}
