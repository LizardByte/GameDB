Tyrian 2000 was a special edition which was released in 1999.\n\nTyrian is nothing like your run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. It gained a following even larger than the classic Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and rightfully so: it has a plot. A plot, you ask? Yes. And even a complex one. You play the role of Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing MicroSol.\n\nThe game also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play. It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls, decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and generators and even add ship \"sidekicks\". Tyrian's complete arsenal amound to over a dozen type of ships and over 100 weapon types!\n\nTyrian 2000 is a direct re-release of the original action smash, Tyrian. It is essentially the same game with an additional new episode (Hazudra Fodder), a revised engine (less bugs and better controls) and added Windows support. It also adds another option called \"Timed Battle\".\n\nSource: Mobygames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpHPwFwAAFU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpHPwFwAAFU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpHPwFwAAFU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpHPwFwAAFU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpHPwFwAAFU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Tyrian 2000 - Gameplay [HD]", "description": "Tyrian is an Arcade Shoot em up game.
