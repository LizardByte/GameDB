It is designed much like Diablo or many more similar ARPGs: there's a small hub, a peaceful town, and several pathways leading to the \"wilderness\" locations, where you encounter monsters and go to fulfill quests.\n\nIn town you could shop, travel to a different location (there are five towns in The Roots), learn some local news, get quests or enter a gladiator arena. The tasks you can get are mostly kill or fetch quests typical for many ARPGs and MMORPGs that can provide you with valuable items in case you succeed and also do it before a deadline, as all of them are time-limited.\n\nTo add interest and replayability there is a randomly generated loot system, such as also in many more RPGs. The items you get come with different stats, that could improve your character's primary abilities, like strength or agility, add damage or raise the defenses and magical resistance. The rarer the item the more modifiers and higher they are, but also such items require certain character level to wield them.\n\nThe role playing system consists of a set of primary stats, usable skills and passive talents specific for each of the five character classes. Skills could be equipped and used on the game map: there are things like empowered attacks as rain of arrows, or something more original when for limited amount of time you could transform into an a giant spider that will let you bruteforce your way around.\n\nThe visual style is somewhat cartoonish in appearance as in another Blizzard game - Warcraft III.Besides the single player mode, it's possible to play together with up to four player characters on the same in-game locations. And at the same time on the arena you can challenge them to a fight.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-roots-gates-of-chaos", "videos": [{"id": 88514, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wJpFxQuIhdI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJpFxQuIhdI", "title": "The Roots: Gates of Chaos - Nokia N-Gage Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wJpFxQuIhdI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
