The Dragon Aussircaex is plaguing the island; a Mindflayer Creature is controlling it with a Mindsunder Artifact. Once the player character destroys the Mindsunder Artifact, Aussircaex destroys the Mindflayer and returns Korthos Island back to its old ways, ending Sahuagin rule. After achieving fame in Korthos Island, the player is sent to Stormreach to gain fame and clear all threats to the city.", "summary": "Centered in the city of Stormreach, DDO is set on the fictional continent of Xen'drik, in the world of Eberron, a Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting.

Players can create their characters following the revised edition of D&D 3.5 rule-set fashion, and play them in both indoor and outdoor environments, including dungeons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeons-and-dragons-online", "videos": [{"id": 2090, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "h19MMBvYAJI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h19MMBvYAJI", "title": "Dungeons & Dragons Online - Eberron Unlimited Update 11 Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h19MMBvYAJI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
