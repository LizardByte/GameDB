The biting northern air threatens to tear the robes of the great knight, \"SIR FRED\". His raging concern for the abduction of the princess he loves is not reflected in his unperturbed countenance. He only pauses for an instant, a fleeting breath to fix, like an arrow, his gaze on the castle walls and grit his teeth in despair.\n\nNever had he faced so many and so great dangers. In every corner, in every room of the great castle of the Beni-Gomez family, death awaits him, lurking.\n\nBut there is no room for doubt and no time to turn back. The decision is already made. The earth runs, almost flies under the firm and implacable thrust of his feet.", "summary": "Sir Fred is a platform game where the protagonist must infiltrate the great castle of Beni-G\u00f3mez to rescue his beloved princess.
