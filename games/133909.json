Instead, the island seems pretty much the same as when he left, but people he knew changed and his rekindled friendship and relationship with people he left behind will bring a change in Kouichi. The game is a visual novel with light background animations, while character only change poses and don't animate during talking, even moving lips while talking and looking in a different direction is done via character stills and not animated. Aside from Kouichi, all NPCs feature full voice-acting. \n \nOriginally released as Clear for PC (Windows), this PlayStation 2 port was done two years after with reduced rating and removed adult content. To compensate for that, the game features new characters, new branching plot, new CG events and new opening song by Ceui. Gameplay interface has also been improved and adjusted for console gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clear-atarashii-kaze-no-fuku-oka-de", "videos": [{"id": 35929, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "lErmFrrGGto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lErmFrrGGto", "title": "Clear - Atarashii Kaze no Fuku Oka de -", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lErmFrrGGto/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35930, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qmedthzPcHc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmedthzPcHc", "title": "Clear ~\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u98a8\u306e\u5439\u304f\u4e18\u3067~ | Clear ~Atarashii Kaze no Fuku Oka de~ [PS2] 01/03", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmedthzPcHc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
