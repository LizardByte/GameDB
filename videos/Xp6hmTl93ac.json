{"id": "Xp6hmTl93ac", "snippet": {"title": "Duck Shoot - Commodore 64 Gameplay (Steam re-release)", "description": "Originally released in 1984, Duck Shoot brought the fun and frustration of funfair-style shooting games to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 home computers.\n\nIt's a classic shooting gallery! Try to rack up as many points as you can by shooting ducks, bunnies, owls, and plates. Keep an eye on your ammo, as you have limited bullets, and watch out for the ducks who spring to live and fly down to try and eat your bullets right out of the UI!\n\nThe gameplay is from the Steam re-release that contains both the C64 and VIC-20 versions. What you're looking at here is the C64 version.\n\nDeveloped by Mr Chip Software\nSteam re-release by Pixel Games UK\nSteam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363630/Duck_Shoot_C64VIC20/\n\n#steam #steamgames ##steamgame #retrogames #retrogaming #commodore64 #c64 #commodore #pixelgamesuk #c64games #commodore64games #mrchipsoftware #pixelgamesuk #duckshoot", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xp6hmTl93ac/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Duck Shoot - Commodore 64 Gameplay (Steam re-release)", "description": "Originally released in 1984, Duck Shoot brought the fun and frustration of funfair-style shooting games to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 home computers.\n\nIt's a classic shooting gallery!
