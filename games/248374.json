As Gale\u00e3o, players will face off against a range of enemies.\n\nThe game's retro-inspired graphics and music will transport players back to the golden age of platformers in the 80s and 90s. The visuals are rendered in 16-bits, giving the game a classic, pixelated look that pays homage to the NES games of old. The music is upbeat and catchy, with chiptune-style melodies that will keep players engaged and motivated as they progress through the levels.\n\nGale\u00e3o's abilities are relatively simple, but players will need to master them to make it through the levels unscathed. He can jump to avoid obstacles and he can also turn into a Tornado when jumping to attack enemies. Players will need to time their attacks carefully to take down enemies without getting hit themselves.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Gale\u00e3o's Dreams is to defeat Gale\u00e3o's evil brother, Peter, and his henchmen, Galebot, the Slippers, and TokTok. Peter's motivation for attacking DreamsLand is simple: he wants to take over the world and plunge it into darkness. Gale\u00e3o is the only one who can stop him, and he'll need to use all his skills and abilities to save the day.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galeaos-dreams", "videos": [{"id": 89080, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Xlwh2rrU4iI"}]}
