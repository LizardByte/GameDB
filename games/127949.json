The kingdom has seemingly secured itself lasting peace as an invasion from the neighboring Kingdom of Lingobard has been repelled. Even King Lute himself spends peaceful days cuddling with six beauties when he is free from his official duties.\n\nHowever, having been routed by General Gladys, the king of Lingobard, Bazalt I, has vowed to retaliate for the disgrace and begins devising a sinister plot. Meanwhile, in one of the major powers of Eurodia, the Kingdom of Fronce, start to appear those who resent the sudden rise of Edelland. The most prominent figure among them is the grand chamberlain of Fronce, Marquis Cuvier. In his plot to crush Edelland, he sets his sight on the succubus queen-consort, Shamsiel. And he is not the only one who finds Shamsiel's existence troublesome. Voices of dissent about the succubus queen rise in the State of Vacatin, the central point of reference of the Church of Holy Rood\u2014Eurodia's most widespread religion.\n\nOblivious to the looming danger are Lute and Shamsiel, aiming-to-wed Gladys, and Lute-devotee Prime Minister Emeralia. What kind of show awaits our heroes facing three powerful opponents: the Kingdom of Lingobard, the Kingdom of Fronce, and the State of Vacatin?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/funbag-fantasy-sideboob-story"}
