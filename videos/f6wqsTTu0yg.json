{"id": "f6wqsTTu0yg", "snippet": {"title": "PSX Longplay [591] Clock Tower", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nFrom Wiki:-\n\"Clock Tower, known as Clock Tower 2 in Japan, is a PlayStation point-and-click survival horror game and a sequel to Clock Tower: The First Fear. It was developed and published by Human Entertainment on December 13, 1996 in Japan, and later published by ASCII Entertainment on October 1, 1997 in North America and February 1998 in Europe. Clock Tower tells the story of Scissorman's return following the incident at the Barrows Mansion.\"\n\nIn this longplay, I play through the game with both characters (Helen and Jennifer) showing each of their story arcs. The character is chosen in the prologue by the not very intuitive method of speaking to a particular character once or twice.. I have unlocked 2 endings (The A Endings for each character (Best?)). There are 10 endings to unlock but I did not feel like playing through 8 more times. I did save all savable characters in each run which did unlock the Secret ??? pages. Each of the two ruins shown can be completed in a quicker time but I tried to show all dialogue and items that was accessible to me to show them off.\n\nThe game has some nice atmospheric sound effects to set the mood of the game. With specific music to alert you to the fact that scissorman is in the area or chasing you. The game has voice acting but only in very specific parts of the game. I dunno if this is an emu bug or not or the actual English version of the game was like this. Just odd that the voice dialogue was used so sparingly here. It does slow the text dialogue down considerably when it plays though.\n\nDuring each Scenario, Scissorman can show up at any time (triggered by path taken when moving around - not really random) When this happens you can make use of hiding places that are available on some screens or maybe a screen while have an item that can be used as a weapon against him. You do have to mix it up in each play through and not use the same places/weapons as scissorman learns to check those areas in the next encounter\n\nAfter the two plays are shown, I go through the content in the secret pages and then show the remaining Scenario that you play through if you send the statue to Rick and play as Helen. Afterwards I show all the collected Hints and use a completed savegame file to show off the remaining endings. Ending D has no FMV and used an in game death sequence. Ending E is shown if go to the wrong place when retrieving the statue. \n\n00:00:00 First Playthrough as Helen (Ending A)\n01:57:10 Second Playthrough as Jennifer (Ending A)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n03:39:02 Secret Pages ???
