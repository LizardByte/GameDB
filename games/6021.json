It features 30 licensed teams, several major leagues and interantional test matches, 25 realistic stadiums, commentary by Andrew Voss, variable weather conditions, and all the action on the field you would expect from a game based on the sport, including advanced moves such as offloads, fend offs, side steps and dummy passes. You can create your own players, teams and competitions, with detailed statistics, and you have to take injuries, sin bins and send offs into account."}
