This map will prep players for MP mode by allowing them to test and refine their load out combinations while perfecting lethal search and destroy skills. \n\nPre-order details here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/236510/\n\nThe game, which has been rated \"M\" by the ESRB, will also be available on the Xbox Live\u00ae online entertainment network for the Xbox 360\u00ae games and entertainment system for $14.99.\n\nTAKEDOWN: Red Sabre is a deadly tactical shooter that is perfect for the player who chooses to engage in deliberate and methodical gameplay as opposed to gamers who want to run in with guns blazing.  Gamers experience lethal, close-quarters battles as a member of the elite Red Sabre team and each scenario is designed to emulate the tactics employed by SWAT teams and SOF units in taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes, tactics and added replayability. TAKEDOWN: Red Sabre is in development by Serellan, a team of veteran developers who have worked on acclaimed titles in the Ghost Recon, Halo, SOCOM, SWAT and F.E.A.R. franchises. The team is led by Christian Allen, the former creative director of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon franchise. \n\nBe part of the community here: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/takedownthegame\nhttp://takedownthegame.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TakedownRedSabre\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TakedownRedSabre/\n\nRegarding Animations: http://goo.gl/KPG0C1", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNal3utqE1Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNal3utqE1Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNal3utqE1Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNal3utqE1Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNal3utqE1Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TAKEDOWN: Red Sabre Gameplay Trailer", "description": "505 Games and Serellan today announced the Steam pre-order program for TAKEDOWN: Red Sabre which will be released this September for $14.99 \n\nThe pre-order features the \"Red Sabre Deadly Killhouse\" unlock which gives players access to the highly challenging, single-player Tango Hunt map designed by Christian Allen, the TAKEDOWN: Red Sabre's designer and head of Serellan.
