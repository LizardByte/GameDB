His journey takes him across an island of diverse territories, populated by an assortment of wild creatures, each of which form part of a complex inter-related food chain. To avenge his father's nemesis and restore goodness to the island, Gerdy must hone his herding skills and ultimately compete in a tournament to become Master Herder. \n \nHerdy Gerdy is primarily a platform game with strategy and puzzle elements. The levels involve Gerdy traversing hazardous areas with timed jumps, avoiding or destroying obstacles. However, a significant portion of the gameplay is dedicated to collecting various animals, leading them onto a safe path, similarly to Lemmings. Each of the animals has its own behavior and skills (e.g. swimming), requiring the player to utilize different tactics to capture them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/herdy-gerdy"}
