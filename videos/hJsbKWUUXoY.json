Fire lasers or bullets. Keep cool and pace your shots, frantically discharge until you overheat, or charge up for massive damage!\n\n- 3 Different Enemies\nFight against troopers, attack dogs and flying drones.\n\n- Shield\nUse your shield to protect yourself and reflect incoming fire! Keep it between yourself and the hounds if you wish to retain ownership of your jugular.\n\n- Practice Mode\nOne type of enemy get you every time? Practice against waves of whatever you want.\n\n-Remember to Dodge!\nEnemy lasers travel slow, but not that slow! To get the high score you must dodge and weave.
