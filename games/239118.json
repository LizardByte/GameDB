{"id": 239118, "name": "Demons vs. Wizards", "slug": "demons-vs-wizards", "summary": "A long time ago, when dragons were still flying above the castles\u2026 When true knights were often fighting for damsels in distress\u2026 When magic was not just a word from some old and dusty fantasy book\u2026 Back at that time the game called Demons vs. Wizards was popular in many taverns scattered across realms, which are long forgotten nowadays. As magic and sword duels were forbidden in most of the inns and taverns, this magic card duel game was the only way to settle the scores with an annoying young wizard, some bully stranger or even a travelling demon.\nDemons vs. Wizards is a 5-10 minute turn-based card and dice game. It is so simple that even a small kid can play it without reading a complicated manual. You can either challenge your friends, or beat the computer controlled opponent to test your luck for today. Two players can play on the same screen, so it truly feels like a real tabletop card game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demons-vs-wizards"}
