The facility is used to store and work on the animatronics if they are unable to \"perform\", or if they need improvements. Tragedy struck at one of the new locations when it was only in its 4th day of operation. A nightguard, someone who was respected amongst the staff, sadly went missing that Thursday night and no one knows why. During the investigation, little traces of blood were found in the office, but mostly in the parts and service room. Your fellow nightguard on the phone says that it was his dad that went missing, he thinks Fazbear Inc. is hiding something. Will you help him?", "summary": "The Fazbear Facility is a FNaF Fangame that is in development or is out right now depending on when you are reading this, all rights to Five Nights at Freddy's belong to Scott Cawthon =", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-fazbear-facility"}
