Instead he ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time and is mistaken for the man Thalos chose as his next familiar. He's put in a trance and the irrevocable blood ritual is performed.\n\nNow Dusty is under Thalos' dark powers, and his mother has been murdered by the insidious vampire Johann. It's Dusty's turn to lead the global vampire-hunting organization, and his job to destroy Johann. He's not ready for either, and he's certainly not willing to be a vampire's familiar.\n\nDusty has no choice but to join forces with the vampire he's irrevocably linked to. He needs his help against a new kind of evil vampire. He just has to make sure he doesn't wind up in bed with his new master in the process.\n\nThalos, the immortal of immortals, has existed for eons, but he's never had a familiar who could share his dreams before. Dusty has a secret he's not letting Thalos unravel. Was their ill-fated meeting truly by chance?\nBased on the bestselling Vampire Slave novel by Yamila Abraham and illustrated by Italian studio Dany&Dany.", "summary": "The world's most ancient vampire, a young and unprepared new leader of a centuries old vampire-hunting organization, thrust together by fate.
