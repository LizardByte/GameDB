The game features some of the traditional angel/demon contractor staples, such as a boy with a succubus and alluring female with a magic snake, but also some more oddball and unorthodox characters, like a gang member with an angry squid attached to his arm, and a dog with a bird form of Satan that follows him around. The cast is very balanced and a lot of fun to play with given their unique designs, tools, and play styles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daemon-bride-additional-gain--1"}
