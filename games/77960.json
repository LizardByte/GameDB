It is an attempt to combine RoL, its single-player predecessor that had seen no development between 2008 and 2012, and The Ruins of the Lost Kingdom Online, which was worked on instead. They can both be accessed from RoLC, but the two games are still kept separate in the sense that play data from one side does not affect the other.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ruins-of-the-lost-kingdom-chronicle"}
