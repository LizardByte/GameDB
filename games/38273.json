Takahashi\n(Gasaraki). Together they created one of the most beloved (in Japan)\nshows in the history of Japanese Animation. The series was later\nreleased (1996) in the US by Central Park Media. The series spanned 19\nvideocassettes, and quickly developed a small, but devoted fan\nfollowing. Its 80's style animation turned off a lot of would-be fans,\nbut those willing to endure the animation were rewarded with one of the\nbest storylines (and also some really cool mecha designs) available in\nthe genre. The series was so popular in Japan that games, toys, and\nmodels are to this day being made. Armored Trooper Votoms: The Battling\nRoad is, the first Votoms game created, and is an\nincredible game. Utilizing the DSP chip (A chip implemented into no\nmore than 15 Super Nintendo/Famicom cartridges) to create a Pseudo-3D\nenvironment, this game looks absolutely wonderful for its time. Since\nits release there has been 5 Votoms Playstation games released", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
