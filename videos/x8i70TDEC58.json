{"id": "x8i70TDEC58", "snippet": {"title": "Where the Bees Make Honey - Launch Trailer | PC and Consoles | NA", "description": "Where the Bees Make Honey tells a story about reflecting on different moments from a childhood, which are played and experienced from an adult perspective. At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout.\n\nIt's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. \n\nWhen the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.\n\nPlayable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.\n\nWhere the Bees Make Honey launches on XBOX One, PlayStation 4, and PC this March.\n\nWhere the Bees Make Honey is the property of Wakefield Interactive LLC, used with permission. \n\nOur website: https://whitethorndigital.com/\nMerch: https://whitethorndigital.com/shop\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnhwPRyPr3GHursotyeu7nw/videos?view_as=subscriber\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/whitethorngames\nFollow our Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/whitethorn_digital/\nLike us on Fackbook: https://www.facebook.com/whitethorngames/\n\nWatch our streams on Mixer: https://mixer.com/whitethorndigital", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8i70TDEC58/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8i70TDEC58/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8i70TDEC58/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8i70TDEC58/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x8i70TDEC58/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Where the Bees Make Honey - Launch Trailer | PC and Consoles | NA", "description": "Where the Bees Make Honey tells a story about reflecting on different moments from a childhood, which are played and experienced from an adult perspective.
