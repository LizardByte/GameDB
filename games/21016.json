It was released for the Sega Dreamcast in March 2006 and was later ported to the PS3 and Xbox 360. The game takes place in an alternate reality based on World War II, and, in a controversial twist, players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of \"the Empire\"), fighting against enemies (\"the Union\") that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers (for example, naval units in Level 2 bear heavy resemblance toward the Imperial Japanese warships).\n\nThis is the upgraded Version of Under Defeat HD (PS3, Xbox 360) made for the Sega Ring Edge 2 arcade System, named Under Defeat HD+.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/under-defeat-hd-plus"}
