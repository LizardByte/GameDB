When you move into the house left to you by your great-aunt, all you find is a cardboard box with a stray cat inside, which needs your help. Your mission is to take care of it and rescue other cats along the way! Feed them and play with them until you can find a new family to take them in.\n\nRescue more than 50 different breeds, from the most common to the rarest. Take care of the cats by feeding them and playing with them in several mini-games. Discover each cat's different personality as you bond with them, and find them a family suitable to their character and needs. Customize, decorate, and furnish your house, and team up with your new neighbors to get them to help along the way. Protect your rescue centre from those seeking to replace it with a luxury hotel. Uncover the secret of your great-aunt's house and the mysterious forest surrounding it.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cat-rescue-story", "videos": [{"id": 116750, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "EC13QzqI8co", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC13QzqI8co", "title": "CAT RESCUE STORY | ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EC13QzqI8co/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
