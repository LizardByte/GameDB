Homerun is a baseball video game from 1978 for the venerable Atari 2600 and plays better than many new baseball games today.... at least for fans of old school games.  Graphically it is ancient and more than 30 years old, but the gameplay holds up three decades later and remains fun and addictive.  This Home Run for Atari 2600 review shows game play of CGR hitting home runs and beaning batters in the head.  Use the adjustable difficulty switch to set the skill level of the opposing team, select which version of the game you want to play and hit a HOME RUN on Atari 2600!  The old school sports games on Atari 2600 aren't very expensive and can be had for free if you pick them up with other games.  But just because they aren't worth squat doesn't mean they aren't fun.
