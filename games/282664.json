Wings is an air combat simulation that uses a control scheme of two joysticks. The first joystick controls your plane and the second controls access to your weapons. It was originally assumed the game would use the CBS Booster Grip controller, due to a prototype box that shows Wings packaged with the controller. Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. Two different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs. The PAL version is more complete, featuring a nice Wings logo and enemy planes, but also contains a bug that causes the game to crash if you continually pull back on the joystick while taking off. In addition, some of the gauges in the PAL version are not function.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wings--3"}
