Being by nature very superstitious, the members of his tribe decided to send him far away from the village. They were too afraid that Twiggy's ugliness would bring bad spirit on the village. They asked him to leave and not come back unless he brought back enough treasures to give as gifts to the spirits. That's how began Twiggy's most exciting adventure as treasure hunter.
