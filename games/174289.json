Your first assignment is operator of the quantum unification measurement device to observe exotic particles passing through a series of test systems.\n\nTo isolate detectors from cosmic rays and other background radiation the system is built deep into the planet's core and tests pass through chambers that journey ever downwards.\n\nYour assignment starts with employee induction and testing on the system, and then you must proceed through each new section to the unlock the next stage. You direct the particles behaviour via high energy transmissions under your control. Be aware that the system has very limited self-protection in place; your job is to manage the operation and eliminate any rogue particles that may affect the results.\n\nWe have noticed some unexpected particle bombardments recently and the previous operator was vaporised during a recent Quantum Mexican Standoff (QMS) event. But fear not, we have updated the training and testing process to better prepare you. Just remember the quantum measurement problem!\n\nGood luck...", "summary": "Forbidden Proton has been developed with over 80 unique frenetic action puzzles inspired by early science fiction with a modern twist.
