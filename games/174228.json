Choose from comic versions of all those loveable AWOLNATION bandmates: Aaron, Christopher, Hayden, David and Kenny. Each is ready for action with their own unique weapons and special attacks. Use those attacks to beat on aliens, yetis, reptilians, bomb-wielding penguins and samurai snowmen as you try to save the girl! You'll collect powerups as you pummel enemies through three extended levels: Artic, Tropical, and Space. Along the way you'll save your bandmates and unlock them for later use. Intuitive controls put you right in the action, and best of all, the game is 100% free!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/awolnation-megalithic-mayhem"}
