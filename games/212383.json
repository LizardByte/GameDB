If the player puts a purple colored Zombie Bomb in the blue section or a blue Zombie Bomb in the purple section, the other Zombie Bombs of the same color explodes, and reduces your score by the bombs that exploded of that color, it is an automatic Game Over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombie-bomb-splode"}
