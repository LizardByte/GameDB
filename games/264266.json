The game was a sequel / remake of the original Airborne Ranger released in 1987 / 1988 for Amiga and various PCs. As the original version, we would have play as a sole airborne military to infiltrate enemy territory to complete various objectives. It\u2019s currently unknown if the SNES version was going to use the same level system as the original game, that created maps and objective locations randomly so missions were never the same.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/airborne-ranger--1"}
