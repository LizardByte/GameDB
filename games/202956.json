They find hope in the glories of the bygone days. They erect cities and factories. They sing the praises of restoration.\nAs for you, Rover from the beyond. Whatever might have led to your awakening, we welcome you to these troubled lands. Your journey here will cross with many others'--and will be marked by mysteries and battles.\nYou shall go down as a legend, one that will bring rejuvenation to mankind.", "summary": "Wuthering Waves is a story-rich open-world game with a high degree of freedom.
