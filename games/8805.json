Between rounds, the alien commander taunts the player through synthesized speech. There is no conclusion to the game, although score is not kept after round 4.

Only one upgrade could be used per round-the upgrades ensured that each round played a little different from the last.", "summary": "Space Fury was one of the many popular vector games developed in the early 1980s in the same model as the famous Asteroids game released by Atari in 1979.
