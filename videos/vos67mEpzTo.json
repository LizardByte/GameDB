Following the Sonic Superstars X McDonald's crossover currently going on in Portugal, a brand new Browser Minigame was made available here for everyone to play! I called it Sonic Superstars - Puzzle Maze (it has no official name). The goal of this minigame is to collect the maximum amount of rings through 5 levels with simple moves. You can play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy in their classic forms! Hope you enjoy it!!!\n\nPlay Sonic Superstars - Puzzle Maze here :\u27a7 https://www.happymealdigital.com/pt-pt/digital/sc27493/\n\nATTENTION: This game only seems to work on Mobile Devices (Android and iOS).
