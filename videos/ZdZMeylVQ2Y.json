Also one of the last games to be released by Ocean for the spectrum, and what a way to go out.\n\nThe video opens up with the intro which opens up with a note which supposedly gives the locations of where your family members are. I played on Hard, so this maybe the reason why the game doesn't track with the intro, i'm not sure though. I've looked at some guides and the positions of the family members are different in each of them. The video is longer then it should have been because I had alot of trouble finding 'Thing' as he was very well hidden. Ideally the caves should have been my last place to visit saving 10 minutes of having to climb out again.\n\nThis is a very colorful and nice looking game for the spectrum and another example where the developer knew what they were doing and wanted to make the game all it could be on the humble spectrum. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdZMeylVQ2Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdZMeylVQ2Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZdZMeylVQ2Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ZX Spectrum Longplay [090] The Addams Family", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nThe Addams Family for Spectrum 128k\n\nA great version of the game.
