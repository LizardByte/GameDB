By taking advantage of loopholes within the Dreamcast's Mil-CD format, Bleemcast! software allows the system to run select PlayStation games, often with enhanced graphics. Each Bleemcast! disc is intended for a single PlayStation game only, and is utilized by first booting the Dreamcast with the Bleemcast! disc, and then later swapping in the PlayStation game at a specific time.\n\nWhile running under Bleemcast!, PlayStation games adopt anti-aliasing and bilinear filtering, as well as an increased resolution of 640x480 (double the PlayStation's 320x240). All released Bleemcast! games require a dedicated VMU to play and save progress, while also supporting the Jump Pack for vibration.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bleemcast-for-metal-gear-solid"}
