Or, well, I'd like it to, but really the keys and doors are the main focus here. It's a puzzle game! Assume the role of the reserved protagonist, Lily, and traverse many different abstract (and maybe beautiful?) landscapes, solving puzzles along the way. The main concept of the game is to bring colored keys to doors of the matching color, however new mechanics are introduced in each new world, with each getting progressively more unhinged and terrifying than the last.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/i-wanna-lockpick"}
