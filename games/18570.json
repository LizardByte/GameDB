Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.\n\nYou fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/killer-satellites", "videos": [{"id": 106322, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_H5ypn9wBiI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H5ypn9wBiI", "title": "Killer Satellites for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_H5ypn9wBiI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
