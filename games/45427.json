It features all of the known characters of the series, such as the Red Arremer (who would get his own game series: Gargoyle's Quest). It also features items from the game, for example the armor icon, which is required for Arthur to move in this game. Not only does it have the most well known characters in the Ghosts 'N Goblins games, it also features remixed music of the series.\n\nAs with the The Incredible Machine games, there are different kinds of puzzles, one of them even involves killing Arthur. However, unlike the The Incredible Machine games, there are no Head-to-Head puzzles and no Freeform Machine mode, so there's only single player puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arthur-to-astaroth-no-nazomakaimura-incredible-toons", "videos": [{"id": 127379, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QrpcDNuxuJY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrpcDNuxuJY", "title": "PSX Longplay [471] Arthur to Astaroth no Nazomakaimura: Incredible Toons", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QrpcDNuxuJY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
