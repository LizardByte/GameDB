The level structures involve different military objectives, of protecting or destroying a particular area. The surprise is in the graphics - patchwork-quilt style landscapes and a remote view, reminiscent of Virus. The game offers joystick and mouse control options, as well as sections in which you must direct ships and planes. A range of weapons are offered, with resupply ships on the water to dock with.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zeewolf-2-wild-justice"}
