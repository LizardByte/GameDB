Cecil Kraven II, father of a classmate and diagnosed schizophrenic, pointing to the outpost's pending eradication at the hands of a cosmic threat.\n\nThis all culminates in a moon buggy trip across the Martian surface with a genetically-modified cockroach, racing against time to save the lives of the colony's innocent denizens.
