She sought the devil's protection in a pagan cult of devil worshipers. Through demonic rites, Margaret became a powerful sorceress, her strength growing with each year. Then the Bloody Judge set off a vicious wave of executions for profit and pleasure. Margaret was condemned to burn. From within the flames, she cast a dreadful curse upon the land. Then she appeared to her daughter, Alucarda.\n\n\"Avenge me, Alucarda! Avenge my death!\"\n\nYou are Alucarda. You begin the game on a quest for vengeance, though this may change as you progress. You begin with no witchcraft abilities, so you must gain them. The game mainly plays like a classic point-and-click adventure game and features a Sierra-style score system. The player needs to examine the environment, collect objects and solve puzzles. There are also first-person combat sections.\n\nWhile the game states that it is shareware and advertises a commercial version that's uncensored and features additional content, no such version has ever been found, leaving most to assume it was never completed.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plague-of-the-moon", "videos": [{"id": 92341, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "RzMDGz7Y8qc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzMDGz7Y8qc", "title": "Plague of the Moon (DOS) - Playthrough/Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzMDGz7Y8qc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
