I played (and enjoyed) the original Playstation game many years ago, but when Tail Concerto 2 was announced for PS2 and then disappeared without a trace (with only one concept and game somewhat related to it released much later, \"Mamoru-kun\" and \"Solatorobo\", part of what is called the \"Little Tail Bronx\" series), I found my copy of TC just collecting dust. Thankfully, it looks like Solatorobo will be coming out overseas (if it hasn't already, I haven't checked).\n\nAnyhoo, this game allows you to play with most of the important characters of Tail Concerto and guest stars Klonoa (from his own great \"Klonoa\" series) and Ran-oh (from another doujin title, \"Tales of Moon\"). They have basic attacks and combo strings and there are a few stages, but the game is significantly incomplete. This is a video using the valiant \"Cyan Garland\".
