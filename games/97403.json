Its victor, the Dark Lord Kayblis, was declared ruler of all of monsterkind.\n\nHis first decree was to take back the human territories using all of the forces at his disposal.\n\nWhile the major human nations of the world attempt to fight off the invading threat, the immense power difference between their armies and the united monster army quickly becomes clear.\n\nHumanity's strength steadily begins to waver in the face of the seemingly unstoppable foe.\n\nThe Human Realm's major world leaders hold a summit to discuss a means of combating the monsters, but are unable to reach an agreement between each other.\n\nJust as all hope seems lost, the man known as Rance stands up:\n\n\"All of you just follow me, okay? I'll smash-up all the monster armies no problem!\"\n\nWhile the summit's attendees are understandably shaken by this bold declaration, they quickly accept it.\n\nThe Kingdom of Leazas' Queen Lia Parapara Leazas.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom of Zeth's Viceroy Magic the Gandhi.\n\nThe Helman Republic's President Sheila Helman.\n\nThe Free Cities Alliance's representative Copandon Dott.\n\nThe eastern nation of JAPAN's ruler Oda Kou.\n\nThe world's largest religion the AL Church's Pope Crook Mofus.\n\nIt is because of these six women, who have each witnessed Rance's heroism save the world from crisis firsthand, that the agreement is reached.\n\nUnder Rance, humanity is united as one.\n\nThus, the great war to determine the future of the Continent begins.", "summary": "Rance X: Showdown is the 13th and final game in Alicesoft's flagship Rance Series, marking the conclusion for the 28-year-old series.
