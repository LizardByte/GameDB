We can observe his personal life and even influence it with side effects.\n\nThe scene of the game takes place in the body of the protagonist. We see everything that happens to him in real-time on the little screen. We have at our disposal various types of cells of the immune system, controlling which we protect the body from the attacks of harmful bacteria and viruses, as well as train the immune system. Special actions can cause side effects that affect the plot. For example, on a date with a girl, the protagonist can vomit and they break up, which makes the hero depressed.\n\nKey Features:\n - Story twists caused by your actions\n - 30 levels (days from the hero's life)\n - Various bosses\n - 8 types of cells of the immune system that can be upgraded\n - Fighting that are requiring difficult tactical decisions\n\nComing soon! 2020\nAdd to Steam Wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1183010/Listeria_Wars/\nDeveloper's site: http://rubelgames.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Rubel_NMB", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K4pYYjb-u8I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K4pYYjb-u8I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K4pYYjb-u8I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Listeria Wars - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "#IndieGaming #TowerDefense\nPlease, wishlist Listeria Wars on Steam - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1183010/\n\nListeria Wars is a tactical strategy where we protect the hero\u2019s body from various infections and viruses by controlling the troops of the immune system.
