Graphics aside, the game is essentially identical to the original Pac Man. Ms. MacPerson (who is controlled with the keyboard) has to make her way through a maze, collect all the pills while staying away from the four ghosts that chases her. By eating special power pill things are turned around and she can go after the ghosts who then run away. A level is completed once all pills have been collected. The player has three lives and when they are used up it's game over. Like in the arcade original there are intermissions between some of the levels."}
