But in the darkest hour the glimpse of hope, the ray of light appeared, and so it happened: the group of american scientists with Dr. Gusev as their lead scientist invented the special photon cannons, that can easily tear demon flesh apart.

These people were genius engineers of their time, but when they opposed the government they were imprisoned as war criminals. But facing the total destruction of all life on Earth the government decided to make a compromise. Now there is only one way for Travis Greenrunner and his people to get their freedom back \u2014 to drive away the demon scum to the place they crawled out from!", "summary": "Of Tanks and Demons III \u2014 it's the new game with the vibe of classic arcades of 80's.\n\nCollect photons, shoot demons, buy new tanks and improve them.
