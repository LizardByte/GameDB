On the way, he must find 15 different datapoints to power up the exit portal.\n\nI really liked this mod! It's really fun! So far, I think this is the longest mod ever created, aside from Black Mesa! The custom music, the environment, the story, the weapon skins, well done! Let's just slow down on the Combine Soldiers next time. There's waaaaaay too many Soldiers, I get tired of killing them! The Turrets in the beginning were pretty tough, that Turret in the water was REALLY unnecessary, and there should be a way to avoid the lasers so the Turrets won't be activated. Let's give other enemies more chances.\n\nRating: 5 Stars\nDifficulty: Normal\n\nLinks:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/strider-mountain\nhttp://www.planetphillip.com/posts/strider-mountain-half-life-2/\nhttp://www.stridermountain.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7U7QFqU0dQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7U7QFqU0dQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7U7QFqU0dQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7U7QFqU0dQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Half-Life 2 Complete Mod Walkthrough - Strider Mountain", "description": "Gordon Freeman must infiltrate Strider Mountain and destroy the source of the main Strider machine, then escape.
