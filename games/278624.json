It's been a colossal collaborative effort from the members of his community, to create one awesome fun game starring his cat, Mallow! And, to accompany him on his journey should you choose 2 player mode, a purple feline known as Zs (based off one of his emotes) comes along for the ride.\n\nMallow the Cat just wants salmon, unfortunately there is no salmon at home, so he ventures out to go find the salmon! There's plenty of secrets and challenges, plenty of custom ASM, yet it keeps a homage to the classic Mario vibe.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the hack as much as we enjoyed making it!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mallow-world"}
