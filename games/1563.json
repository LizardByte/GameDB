The game tells the tale of warriors searching for the ultimate sword, \"Soul Edge\". It has been given many names throughout the history, such as \"The Sword of Salvation\", \"The Sword of Heroes\" and \"The Ultimate Sword\", among others. Many strong warriors searched for years, but very few actually found it. The sword, currently in the form of a twin pair of long swords, appeared mysteriously in an auction. It was taken by the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon and nothing is known of his fate thereafter. Presently, nine warriors from around the world (Hwang, Li Long, Mitsurugi, Rock, Seong Mi-na, Siegfried, Sophitia, Taki, and Voldo) search for the sword for different reasons. Some desire its power, others want revenge. Some, believing that it is a benevolent sword, crave its support. Others, knowing of its evil nature, seek its destruction. Nothing is known for certain about the sword, except for one thing: it brings misfortune to those seeking it.", "summary": "Soul Edge is an arcade fighting game developed by the team Project Soul and published by Namco.
