It took me a while to realise you have to press space to get the computer to take throw ins and goal kicks. You can barely pass and if you try and run with the ball the computer just takes it from you and it's very hard to get the ball back. If you try and do anything at all in your own penalty area you concede a penalty. It's a bug ridden mess.
