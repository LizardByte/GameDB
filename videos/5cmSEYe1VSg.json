{"id": "5cmSEYe1VSg", "snippet": {"title": "Urban Runner (1996) PC Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Sierra's 1996 PC game, Urban Runner.\n\nBoth endings have been included. The first begins at 1:51:44, and the second at 1:58:35. The awesome \"game over\" screen music that is never heard anywhere but for when you fail or when you finish the game plays at 2:01:10.\n\nEven though it met with a lot of derision when it came out, Urban Runner is one of the most entertaining FMV games ever released in the glut of the mid 1990s PC landscape. It's extremely short and pretty easy, but the awesome video quality (given its recommendation for a Pentium 90 to run well in high color mode at a time when most people were still on 486s), the super corny overdub over a pretty distinctly French produced action film, and a nonstop stream of action (with huge narrative jumps all over the place) make it worthwhile. It was also the pseudo-sequel to Coktel's earlier (and somewhat awesome) Lost in Time.\n\nI remember this game being incredibly hard to find when it was released. I eventually found it about six months later on a clearance shelf in some shop on Tottenham Court Rd in London for 12 pounds during a lunch break, and I never once regretted buying it. \n\nEven if you have no desire to play it, take a look. It's wicked entertaining.\n\n___________________________\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cmSEYe1VSg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cmSEYe1VSg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cmSEYe1VSg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cmSEYe1VSg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Urban Runner (1996) PC Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Sierra's 1996 PC game, Urban Runner.\n\nBoth endings have been included.
