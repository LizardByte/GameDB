The object of the game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles (trees, stumps, dogs, etc.) The player can also opt to partake in three modes: slalom, freestyle, and tree slalom. In slalom, players must properly ski around flags in an attempt to complete the run with the shortest time possible. Tree slalom adds obstacles to the slalom run. In freestyle, players ski downhill and jump off ramps while racking up points by performing tricks. Deductions are imposed for colliding into obstacles or failing to land properly after a stunt. When the player passes the 2,000-meter mark, the Abominable Snowman appears and starts to chase the player, eating them if it catches them.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skifree", "videos": [{"id": 5077, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Jvtq-ql0LmY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvtq-ql0LmY", "title": "How to play SkiFree (Epic gameplay with happy ending)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jvtq-ql0LmY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
