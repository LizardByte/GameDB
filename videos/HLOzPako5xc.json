However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing.\n\nThe story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild.

These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills!\n\n\u25a0Can you handle it?!\nAside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new \"Mission\" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on. In addition to the main story and missions is a wealth of subquests, making this title truly the whole package. In fact, after finishing the game, there may be still much more to do than one might think!\n\n\n=================\nSupported models:\nThis game operates on 3rd generation and later iPhone3GS/iPod touch (later than iOS4.3).\nThe game will not run correctly on the 1st and 2nd generation iPhone 3G and iPod touch.\n=================\n\nSearch for Kemco's video with the keyword \"KemcoGames\"!\n\n\u25a0Kemco's Twitter is below!\n@KEMCO_OFFICIAL\nhttp://twitter.com/KEMCO_OFFICIAL\n\n\u25a0Search for Kemco's game with the keyword \"Kemco\"!\n\n====================================\nKEMCO's official Facebook page is below!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/kemco.global\nSale information is available by pressing the \"Like!\" button.\n====================================\n\niTunes Store Page:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/rpg-alphadia-2/id578881449\n\nHomepage:\n\nhttp://www.kemco-games.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLOzPako5xc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLOzPako5xc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLOzPako5xc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLOzPako5xc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLOzPako5xc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "RPG Alphadia 2 - iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad - HD Gameplay Trailer", "description": "RPG Alphadia 2 by Kotobuki Solution Co., Ltd.\n\nThe next installment in the smash hit JRPG series, Alphadia II, is finally here!
