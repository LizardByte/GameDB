The player controls a small square, navigating it across a grid of tiles. The challenge lies in the fact that some of the tiles disappear after being stepped on, and the objective is to reach the exit without falling off the grid. The game requires careful planning and strategic movement, as each level increases in difficulty with more complex tile patterns and obstacles. Its minimalistic yet challenging design paired with its great music has made Sensitive a memorable classic for C64 fans.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensitive"}
