Strange landscapes. Unfamiliar people. She loved meeting new people\u2026\nShe would say, those raised under a high ceiling will grow taller\u2014and seeing the world makes a person bigger.\nDuring the summer vacation of my second year in high school, I too went on a trip far away. It was a training camp for extracurricular activities, but it was by no mistake a trip.\nBy train and car, we headed to the southern sea. With our swords and gi packed, we headed to teh temple gate of the cape overlooking Oniga Island.
