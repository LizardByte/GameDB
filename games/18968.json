Campaign is a return to the gritty, military roots of the franchise, while boldly looking ahead, delivering a rich and engaging narrative that is unlike anything to date in a Call of Duty game. The player will embark on a classically-styled story about grand scale warfare, set in a future where human conflict has spread throughout our solar system.\n\nMultiplayer combines popular mechanics such as the chained-based movement system, with a load of gameplay innovations to deliver one of the deepest and most engaging online experiences in gaming. The new Zombies mode will thrill co-op players with an original, distinctive approach and an uproarious narrative sure to excite fans. The title introduces stunning, multi-planetary environments, new weaponry, and all-new player abilities.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 7976, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EeF3UTkCoxY"}, {"id": 8548, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PpcNQNJmU9Y"}, {"id": 9882, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y_RI3bZhU50"}]}
