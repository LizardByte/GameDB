The player takes on the role of a marine in the Pacific campaigns and both British and American soldiers in the European campaign. Unlike the PC \"World at War\" titles, Final Fronts has a training level. The War in the Pacific and Victory in the Pacific Campaigns see Private Joe Miller (a reference to World at War protagonist C. Miller) and his fellow soldiers Sgt. Roebuck and Pvt. Polonsky (also in World at War) fight their way through Japanese defenses on Guadalcanal, Betio, Saipan, and Okinawa. A major difference in the American campaign from World at War is the fact that both Roebuck and Polonsky survive the final battle for Okinawa (also, Sgt. Roebuck shares a similar character model to Sgt. Dixon from Call of Duty 3). The Winter Offensive and Victory in the Europe campaigns have three protagonists: Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the US 80th Infantry Division of George S. Patton's Third Army, Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airborne Division, and Gunnery Sergeant Alex McCall of the US 4th Armored Division. The Winter Offensive campaign sees the Americans and British move to relieve the city of Bastogne (while the 80th take Ettelbruck in Luxembourg), and the Victory in Europe campaign sees the British 6th Airborne Division capture the town of Weser during Operation Varsity and the Americans capture Adolf Hitler's birthplace of Braunau-am-Inn in Austria.", "summary": "Call of Duty: World at war - Final Fronts is a first-person shooter game. It focuses is on single-player campaigns, as it has no multiplayer. The game is set in World War II. The player can carry two guns at one time, as well as grenades. Levels are played with a team of soldiers from both Britain and the U.S, that assist the player by killing enemies and completing objectives. The game has been criticised by some critics for the poor AI, which is evident when friendly soldiers push you out of cover and into the enemy line-of-fire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-world-at-war-final-fronts"}
