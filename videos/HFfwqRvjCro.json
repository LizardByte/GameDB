You can build and maintain trap towers anywhere in the improvised pinball field. To activate the trap you should hit it with a ball. Besides you can do damage to aliens directly with a ball. Damage from the ball can be temporarily increased by colliding with several traps in a row (the ball getting hotter from this so it can do more damage). Each level contains a central mechanism that can be controlled by the player. The main purpose of the game is to destroy the mothership flying saucer.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFfwqRvjCro/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFfwqRvjCro/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFfwqRvjCro/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFfwqRvjCro/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFfwqRvjCro/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mr.Welder's Pinball Defence Trailer", "description": "Mr.Welder is a common hard worker and a huge fan of pinball machines.
