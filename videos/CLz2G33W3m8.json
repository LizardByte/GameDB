Lemmings\n05:39:34 ? Oh No! More Lemmings\n\nLemmings is a puzzle video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint. The Game Boy Color port was released in 2000 and contains both the original game and the expansion Oh No! More Lemmings. The Japanese version of this game, called VS Lemmings, has an additional feature of multiplayer mode, available by connecting two GBCs together.\n\nHatches and exit doors are bizarre in this port. Hatch doors are solid destructible walls. Hatch ceiling is destructible and can be walked on left to right but not right to left. Exit doors can?t be built trough or nearby (in the latter case, a Builder will turn away). Exit doors can be Dug, Mined, Bashed and Bombed through, but they don?t count as terrain.\n\nI tried to save Lemmings whenever possible, but there probably are a few levels that could?ve been solved better. The name of Wicked 7 (Lemming Tendencies) was censored in this port: it is supposed to be Suicidal Tendencies. After beating the game, I show traps, hazards and Game Over screen. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CLz2G33W3m8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CLz2G33W3m8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CLz2G33W3m8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Color Longplay [150] Lemmings & Oh No!
