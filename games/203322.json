As the story goes, a whole mess of insects have escaped from a laboratory. Gone. The hapless scientist at the lab charges the player with the task of finding the same bugs that fit the lab's specimen needs. The setting of the game takes place during summer vacation and the player adopts the persona of a boy with a fascination for insects. A rascally blue-haired girl plays the part of a rival that is also collecting specimens for the lab and barging in on your action."}
