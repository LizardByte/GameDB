The game was made to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series. The game features a character-switching feature, similar to the spin-off, Samurai Warriors: Chronicles, with which players can take two characters into battles simultaneously, and freely switch between the two. Two new moves, \"Hyper Attacks\" and \"Rage Mode\" are featured in this game: Hyper Attacks is a secondary moveset available to all characters that allows the player to sweep through and clear out crowd of enemies with a dashing animation, although it is useless against enemy officers, as they will either deflect it or are otherwise immune against it. Rage Mode renders the player invincible for a period of time, and also enhances the player's attacks as well as empowering their Muso attack by using the Spirit Gauge. Duels are featured, which occur when player-controlled characters meet with enemy officers under specific conditions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 2570, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "pQyoQj0eoZo"}, {"id": 2571, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QDPoaDjT2DM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDPoaDjT2DM", "title": "Samurai Warriors 4 - Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QDPoaDjT2DM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
