They feed upon a power known as EXS, which they gain by attacking humans caught within the Hollow Night.

After surviving a Void attack, high school student Hyde Kido receives the power to summon Insulator, a magical sword killing In-Births. A immortal girl named Linne offers to train him with powers on the condition that when he is ready, he will end her life. Caught in a battle by others vying for control over EXS, Hyde finds a way to survive until the next night.", "summary": "Under Night In-Birth is a 2D fighting game co-developed by Ecole Software and French-Bread.
