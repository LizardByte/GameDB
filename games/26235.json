Zoom \nSelect ZOOM icon and press the fire button. When it turns from \nred to green move the joystick, this will move the black box on \nthe map from depot to depot. \n \nAllies depots indicated by gray flags: \nsaved depots turn blue, \nlost depots turn red. \n \nWith zoom icon green, press fire button. Depot status will zoom \nup to reveal the number of tanks (red=enemy, blue=allies), fuel \n(oil drums) and supplies (tents). These supplies/fuel will be \nused by 'Lone Wolf' to repair and refuel his tank (decrease \ndamage gauge). \n \nNumber in lower right hand corner equals hours remaining before \ndepot will fall. \n \n2, Radio \nLone Wolf's heading is determined by selecting the RADIO icon. \nWhen icon turns green, push joystick right or left to move radio \nbeacon. Press fire button again to activate Lone Wolf's secret \nenigma decoder. This special radio device intercepts Rommel's \norders. The first word the player hears indicates the type of \nenemy force; for example \"stukas\", \"minefields\", etc., directly \nahead. Later words indicate outlying enemy positions. \n \nThrough careful selection of the radio beacon heading, Lone Wolf \ncan thread his way through enemy forces to rescue his besieged \ndepots. \n \nStrategy Tip: Listen for radio static. Static indicates no enemy \nforces in an immediate area. Avoid confrontation whenever \npossible and head for the wide open spaces. (The shortest \ndistance between 2 points is not always a straight line.) \n \n3. Air Strike \nWhen a depot is in danger of being wiped out (their status should \nbe checked throughout the game) and Lone Wolf is too far away for \na rescue mission, call in a spitfire airstrike to buy time. \n \nHighlight the AIRSTRIKE icon in green (using fire button). \nWhen arrow appears at a depot, move joystick until the correct \ndepot has been selected. Press fire button and air strike will \nbegin. If you choose not to send in an air strike, simply cycle \nthe arrow through all depots and the airstrike icon will \nturn red again. \n \nNOTE: it takes time for air strike to reach its destination. \nLone Wolf only has \"one\" air strike per game. \n \n4. Swastika \nIndicates location of Rommel who pursues Lone Wolf around the \nmap. Once the Desert Fox is within range, it is a duel to the \ndeath! It takes 8 hits to make Rommel surrender. If successful, \nyou will receive 8000 points for each one depot saved. \n \n5. Score \nAccumulated score to date. \n \n6. Tank Status Gauge \nIndicates total accumulated damage to Lone Wolf's turbo Sherman \ntank. When this gauge flashes yellow, Lone Wolf is in serious \ntrouble. \n \nStrategy tip: To reduce damage, get to minefield and blow up \nmines. Save convoys to increase depot supplies. \n \nAvoid the Desert Fox unless damage is low!!!!!! \n \n7. Surrender Time \nIndicates hours remaining for depot that has last been zoomed. \n \n \n*** Convoy *** \n \nObjective: to protect allied convoy by shooting down enemy stukas. \n \nJoystick: left/right to fire guns. \n Firebutton inactive, sights line up aircraft automatically. \n \nScore 100 points for blasting each stuka (red).. but be careful \nfor each enemy stuka is being pursued closely by allied spitfires \n(green), and for each accidentally shot down you lose 300 pts. \n \nRequired scores to save convoy: \n5000 challenger \n5200 crusader \n5400 strategy \n5600 master \n5800 grandmaster \n \nWhen a convoy is saved, the currently selected depot is given \none tank, one supply tent, and one fuel barrel. \nThis buys the depot more time against the enemy and the added \nsupplies will reduce the player's damage when that depot is saved. \n \n \n*** Tiger Tank *** \n \nObjective: to destroy enemy Tiger tanks en route to depot. \n \nJoystick: push left/right to line up enemy tanks. \n You can \"steer\" cannon fire into enemy tanks. \n \nRadar pinpoints location of Tiger tanks. Push left or right to \nget enemy tank in front of you in order to squeeze it out of \nshots. \n \nLone Wolf must destroy 5 (five) tanks in order to score 5000 \npoints and advance to the next challenge. \n \nThe warning sound indicates enemy has fired at Lone Wolf. \n \nStrategy tips: Lone Wolf can shoot out enemy shots before they \nreach his tank. When enemy fires quickly turn left or right \nto avoid his shot, then turn back and nail the sucker!! \nThere is a firing delay as your cannons reload. \n \n \n*** Minefield *** \n \nObjective: to successfully steer through a minefield as fast as \nyou can without sustaining very much damage. \n \nJoystick: push left and right to get 'slalom ' action between and \nover mines. \n \nPush forward to speed up when tank gets stuck in sand. Pull back \nto slow down. Press fire to blow up mines in front. \n \nNOTE: You must center the blue compass heading. If you go off \ncourse you risk damage and loss of time. \n \nUpon hitting a mine, the tank will become stuck in sand, and time \nspeeds up to indicate time spent digging the tank out. \nTo avoid wasting time in the minefields, get moving as soon as \nyou see your tank treads getting covered in sand!!!! \n \nStrategy tip: whenever Lone Wolf has sustained high damage \nlevels, find a minefield and carefully shoot out many mines. \nThis will decrease your damage. \n \n \n*** Ambush *** \n \nObjective: to get through the canyon ambush with as little damage \nas you can. \n \nJoystick: push in any direction to line up sights on enemy mortar. \nHold fire button down to spray machine gun fire. \n \nStrategy tips: keep firing at center screen area near end of \ncanyon. Once mortar has moved past that area, it is not worth \nshooting or loading last shot. \nAlso: avoid enemy ambush at night, mortars are very hard to spot \nat night. \n \n \n*** Stukas *** \n \nObjective: shoot down stuka divebombers. \n \nJoystick: up= cannon sights up \n down= cannon sights down \n left/right=left/right \n \nRadar locates stuka similar to function of radar scope in Tiger \nsequence. The Lone Wolf takes damage whenever the stuka planes \nfire upon him (gun sound). \n \nYou must score 5000 points (5 stukas) to conmplete this section. \n \nNOTE: cannon takes \"time\" to be selective on shots. 'Lead' the \nstukas with cannon sight and blast them before they have an \nopportunity to cause damage. Like the Tiger sequence, you can \nturn your shots into enemy targets. \n \nStrategy tip: after stuka has strafed you turn around and fire \nat the stuka flying away--- they are more vulnerable then. \n \nNOTE: each campaign lasts at least 24 hours, which means there \nare day, dusk, night, and dawn sequences. Rommel's forces are \ndifficult to locate during the night and dusk sequences \n(especially stuka and minefield) so avoid them then. \n \n------------------------------------------- \nSound adjustment: \n Press F1 key at main menu. Move joystick up or down for \nseveral seconds to get maximum sound response. Press fire \nbutton to lock in. \n \n-------------------------------------------- \n \nGood luck! And push that sucker back into the sea.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
