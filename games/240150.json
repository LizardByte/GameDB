The player then goes on a subsequent trip, and must match photographs from the previous expedition to whales seen on the next trip.\n\nIn Secrets of Hosea Freeman you have moved into an old house formerly owned by by a whaler of New Bedford, Massachusetts. During the night, you see an image of an old man holding a coin and a piece of paper. You seek out to solve the mystery. The player explores the rooms of their large home, seeking clues left by Hosea Freeman. The player discover that Hosea had started out as a whaler, but had began to love and respect whales.

This is a multiple choice game, where the player must correctly choose options from a whale rescue guide.\n\nIn Manatee Rescue, after working with Bill Martinez, the player is then hired to protect manatees off the coasts of Florida.
