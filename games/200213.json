Simply swipe anywhere on the screen to guide the characters through the puzzle, but don't forget! They always move in opposite directions!\n\nOver the course of 66 levels, you will encounter obstacles like rocks, holes, portals or speedpads. By mastering these levels, you will earn coins with which you can buy new character pairs. These pairs live in different worlds, so playing with them may change the style of the game completely! You may even end up in space!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/asymmetric"}
