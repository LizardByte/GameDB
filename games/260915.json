It is the second WAD in the 3 heures d'agonie series, and like its predecessor, the concept was that each map was designed within a three hour time period, though differing from most speedmapping events in that there was no singular mapping period, allowing authors to make multiple maps. The project was released on 30 November, 2014.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-heures-dagonie-ii"}
