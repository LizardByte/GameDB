The \"chez\" has three floors, with one table in the first, one in the second and three on the top floor. Customers enter from one of the four doors to the restaurant, sit and wait for their orders. The cook places a meal in the dumb-waiter and Maxime has to get it when it passes by the floor where he's standing in an elevator shaft.\n\nCustomers get angry for waiting for too long. They arrive green, but turn red as they grow angrier and finally start jumping in their places when they're really furious. If Maxime serves them, they'll return to their calm (green) state and will leave. If Maxime fails to serve them when their furious, they'll leave. If four customers leave unserved, the game is over.\n\nTo make things a bit more difficult, a dog enters the restaurant every now and then, trying to steal Maxime's tray. If Maxime has his hands free, he'll kick the dog out; if he's carrying his tray, the dog will bite Maxime's legs, making him fall, and will steal the tray.", "summary": "Chez Maxime is a management game released in Europe in 1983 on the Magnavox Odyssey.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chez-maxime", "videos": [{"id": 35252, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UNOgyZNXi5Y"}]}
