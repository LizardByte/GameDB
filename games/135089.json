The game features falling blocks that you must hit in time with the beat when they reach the judgement line.\n\nThe game is played with the Wonderswan held vertically. A scratch attachment is included that you mount on the console to be able to trigger the scratch button more easily. Unlike the Game Boy versions of Beatmania, beatmania for WonderSwan features the original versions of the songs, instead of 8-bit renditions.\n\nThe game is played in rounds, with each round giving you a selection of songs, as you clear the round a new selection with harder songs is made available. There are 11 songs included in the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-for-wonderswan"}
