With half of the Earth\u2019s population dead, almost the entire planet surface became unfit for living due to radioactive contamination. However the Soviet Union was ready for such an outcome. The military machine had mobilized and was operating at full throttle sometime prior to the world catastrophe. The country underwent a full evacuation of the citizens, industrial facilities and companies of the utmost importance to a pre-built network of specially equipped bunkers.\n50 years later. 2012\u2026 The fragments of the socialist empire that were hastily brought underground have gradually become a real state with its own capital, a city called Pobedograd. The key goals of the Nuclear Union used to be, and still are, the survival of the population and the restoration of an industrial base against the background of the aggressive environment.\nThe powerful Soviet empire even survived the end of days. Survived and continued to develop in an absolutely new and vulnerable world. This unusual story of unusual people starts here, underground, in Pobedograd. The protagonist of Nuclear Union is a Soviet officer who participated in the nuclear war with the USA. This past of his is nothing compared to what he is about to live through in this new dangerous world, bathed in the rays of merciless radiation.\nIt is common knowledge that anyone who\u2019s about to face danger should always be holding a weapon in their hands. Experts of firearms will love the range of weaponry to fight enemies included in Nuclear Union. The arsenal of those who survived the nuclear apocalypse, and the decimation of the military complex, led to the best Soviet fire arms that never went into mass production being preserved in the Nuclear Union as operational prototypes. For instance, a three-barreled submachine gun TKB-059, AO-46 (aka \u201cSoviet UZI\u201d) for 5.45 mm bullets, and the TKB-022PM bullpup assault rifle.\nYou have lots of questions now Comrade. Be patient. And note that Pobedograd will stand regardless. It will survive because of you.", "summary": "Nuclear Union was an upcoming postapocalyptic nuclear-strike video game developed by Best Way, and published by 1C Company, to be released in 2014 Q2 exclusively for Microsoft Windows.
