Deploy your tanks and artillery and then fire at your enemy using your grid screen to find and destroy their tanks and artillery before your tanks and artillery are taken out. The first player to destroy all of the opponent's tanks and artillery wins the game. Play against either another player or against the smart Ai player, either way winning won't come easy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battleground"}
