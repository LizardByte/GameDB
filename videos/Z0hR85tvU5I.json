{"id": "Z0hR85tvU5I", "snippet": {"title": "Other Boat Race (F1 Race hack)", "description": "This thing not related to Road Fighter hack , which is too called \"Boat Race\".\n\nThis is F1 Race hack with different graphics. Music in menu is removed, now have background with animated boat (futuristic looking? i think). F1 cars changed to (futuristic?) boats, background too changed. Interesting things is glitchy graphics (may will notice how watching this video). Score mispelled to \"Scroe\" and Pause sometimes doesnt works (thats odd...). Tracks are some doesnt changed. Yet interesting thing is every levels in the hack are Stage 1 or 2 and 3 (like Cheetahmen games where fourth level is as third)\nFor uknown reason every board are flashing (may this by of the emulator).  \n\nDownload link: \nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/5xjtb1614eo2pj7/Boat+Race+%28Unl%29.nes", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0hR85tvU5I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0hR85tvU5I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0hR85tvU5I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Other Boat Race (F1 Race hack)", "description": "This thing not related to Road Fighter hack , which is too called \"Boat Race\".\n\nThis is F1 Race hack with different graphics.
