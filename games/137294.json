Collect kyber crystals to construct your unique lightsaber, then head to the Droid Depot to get a trusty companion to accompany you on missions.\n\nBe careful who you trust. Batuu is home to the scruffy and the scheming, the noble and the brave; so choose your allies carefully. First Order, Resistance or Scoundrels - the choice is up to you.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a faction, complete missions, collect rewards and earn reputation points.
