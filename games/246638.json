It was a continuation of The Void's collaborations with Disney and ILMxLab now also involving Walt Disney Animation Studios. It consists of a series of minigames set within the sequel's portrayal of the Internet, including a sequence (referencing a children's mobile game seen in the film's trailer) where the players must fight off invading bunnies and kittens using pancakes and milkshakes as ammo. It was written by Ralph Breaks the Internet screenwriter Pamela Ribon in collaboration with Tracy Hickman. Direction was again done as a creative collaboration between The VOID and ILMxLab.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ralph-breaks-vr"}
