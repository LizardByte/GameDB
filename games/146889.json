Long ago, an elf named Loriel created and sold artifacts in a cozy little shop. When he moved away, there was no one to take over. Although new to magic, you have decided to re-open the shop and return it to its former glory. As customers place their orders, you must race to create the items they want. If your guests have to wait too long, they become impatient and eventually leave. Not to worry, though. You can use spells that help you collect the elements you need, and enchantments that will make your patrons happy again."}
