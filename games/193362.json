It was announced by Ubisoft on the 11th of April, 2006, shortly after the cancellation of Phoenix Studio's unrelated Rayman 4 project. Under development by Ubisoft Montpellier, the game was to be a free-roaming action platforming game, in which the player would control Rayman as he battled against an invading army of Rabbids. The game was announced for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, and the Nintendo Wii, which was then codenamed the 'Revolution'.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-raving-rabbids--2", "collections": [{"id": 7691, "name": "Raving Rabbids"}]}
