It takes a couple of cues from Pac-Man as it has tunnels you can walk into to warp to another part of the screen when you\u2019re feeling trapped. There are 3 eggs laid by the chickens, a white one that gives you points, a red one enables temporary invincibility and the ability to kill the green snakes, and a yellow egg will advance you to the next level."}
