As the player's team takes on more missions, the assignments get tougher; at one point, Spectre may challenge a Jade Falcon group led by Aisa Thastus to a duel. The Star Colonel - Aisa Thastus - will join the player's team as a bondsman if the Falcons are defeated in this mission. It is a beach-side battle that pits 8 of Spectre's best against 10 of hers. That mission can be substituted for a mission to attack the Falcons in a sneak attack where the battle is just as difficult. This direction leads to the death of Asia instead of her joining the team.\n\nDepending on how the player handled allegiance between House Steiner and House Davion, they would end up with one of two mission paths, with 3 different endings.", "summary": "The sequel to Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance.
