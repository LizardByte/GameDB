{"id": "YdbeNzq3Wa4", "snippet": {"title": "Battle Hunter Game Sample - Playstation", "description": "Original Air Date: May 12th, 2009\n\nPart of the \"SuperLite\" series and it shows, Battle Hunter is one of those \"You get what you pay for\" games. Released at $10, this is a ripoff... for A1 and Success anyway. To be honest, this game is slightly underrated. The translation is laughable and the visuals are less than stellar, but the gameplay premise is very fun and ultimately rewarding and some of the music is really awesome. It would be sweet if there was an expansion to this game.\n\nThe beginning may prove frustrating due to your character's limitations and the over-abundance of luck on the CPU's behalf, but the game becomes more exciting the more you play. The idea of the game is to run around finding treasure during missions and bringing it back to your client. There are several items on each map, but you're only required to find one. Anything extra is on you and increases the danger ten-fold. It sounds simple enough, but you'll be faced by three other hunters who can lay traps and fight just like you, as well as monsters who can prove to be quite a challenge. \n\nYou can get various kinds of items; Some are worth money, others are equipment, and a few others provide various extras like different wallpapers and such. The best part about this game is the multiplayer, as four people can play (and there are some obvious flaws in the computer AI which you'll notice after a few missions). Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YdbeNzq3Wa4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YdbeNzq3Wa4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YdbeNzq3Wa4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Battle Hunter Game Sample - Playstation", "description": "Original Air Date: May 12th, 2009\n\nPart of the \"SuperLite\" series and it shows, Battle Hunter is one of those \"You get what you pay for\" games.
