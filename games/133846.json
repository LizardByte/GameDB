Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.", "summary": "Insurmountable is a strategic adventure game with roguelike elements, in which you have to overcome a dangerous randomly generated mountain. Confront the differing terrains as a lonely mountaineer and make your way through Ice, Snow and Stone. Use items to keep up your steadily sinking stats, while making your way up and down the insurmountable heights. The dynamic and ever-changing weather system, the day-night cycles, and numerous other events will make sure that you meet tough challenges on your journey to the top.\n\nTo live up to these challenges, you are able to improve your character. By earning experience points through events, you can choose skills to help you with certain playstyles. One of the serveral roguelike elements is permadeath, which forces you to try various strategies in your pursuit to summit the mountain.\n\nThe game focuses, on the one hand, on the decisions you make in a risky environment full of uncertainties, on the other hand, on evoking intense emotions people experience in such a harsh and savage environment.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/insurmountable", "videos": [{"id": 49081, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "dW6ld-qD8Ag"}, {"id": 112069, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "eRBmFsTghbU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBmFsTghbU", "title": "Insurmountable | Out Now on Consoles!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eRBmFsTghbU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
