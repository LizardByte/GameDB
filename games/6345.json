She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls. Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.\n\nCasper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare \"Fleshies\" and thwart Casper's efforts. The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
