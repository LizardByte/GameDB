It was released in early 2013 - two and a half decades after the last officially licensed SG-1000 game, The Black Onyx in 1987. The game is relatively simple - all the user must do is dodge asteroids while travelling upwards. The game is available in both cartridge and cassette form. \n \nThe SG-1000 is one of many platforms to receive this game. The basic concept was created by Revival Studios in 2008 for CHIP-8 compatible systems of the late 1970s before being retooled for the Magnavox/Philips Odyssey\u00b2 in 2011. Near identical copies to this SG-1000 version are available for the ColecoVision and MSX.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
