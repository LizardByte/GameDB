Lara Croft has returned to the Overworld to raid some tombs or something; meanwhile, Demon Smalls has returned to his home, the museum/gallery at Demon Heights.\n\nAnd now, a year or so later, he is finally ready to reopen the museum to the public. Included among the new exhibits are various homages to the great W. Heath Robinson (Demon Smalls counts himself as a personal fan). However, the most complicated of the WHR machines remains in its packing cases - even Demon Smalls can't figure this one out. He needs a thinking cap. As luck would have it, a millinery store has opened a branch at Demon Heights.\n\nLara has been invited back to Demon Heights to view the exhibits and assist in procuring a thinking cap for Smalls.", "summary": "The sixth entry in The Lizard King series.
