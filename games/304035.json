Players must find and collect keys to unlock gates to the next level. The worlds are populated with monsters, including aggressive wolves and rabbits. Players use ranged missile attacks and limited flight abilities to combat these creatures.\n\nThere are seven characters to choose from, differing only in appearance. Points are earned by defeating enemies and collecting amulets. Other collectibles, like stones and chests, boost health or reduce monster damage. Stepping on anthills affects player abilities, either positively or negatively. Players have three lives per level and must restart the level if all lives are lost.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/odens-oga"}
