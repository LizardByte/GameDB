The levels are short and sweet with a focus on action-packed platforming (inspired by the Japanese style of hacking). However, this hack is not your typical platformer. In Nachos and Fried Oreos, a game-over is truly a game-over! If you lose all your lives, your save file is deleted and you must start from the beginning.\n\nThe game includes 4 difficulties that determine the amount of lives you will start with. In addition, every level has 5 dragon coins and a moon. Collecting them will grant you a different reward based on your difficulty.\n\nIf you are a casual player and you would never touch a \"hard\" or \"very-hard\" hack, that's okay! That's exactly why we have created beginner mode. On this difficulty, you will be given infinite lives and can enjoy the hack at your leisure. Still, be aware that this hack is pretty tricky, even on beginner mode. If you are a more advanced player and love the adrenaline and excitement of beating a challenging segment, then playing on advanced/expert/master is for you!\n\nIncompatibility notice! This hack has been known to crash on both the SNES Classic and the Super Famicom. Play at your own risk.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nachos-and-fried-oreos"}
