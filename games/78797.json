With grey-scale graphics it tells the story of an alien detective trying to find out where all the human tourists have gone missing. In the process you will meet characters such as the bartender Baked Potato and a blind psychic pianist. Yep, it is a humouristic take on the noir genre.\n\nThe game plays as a traditional point and click adventure game. This means that the game is played with your brain, rather than with quick reflexes. Puzzles are solved in order to progress through the story. It is developed using Tim Furnish' SLUDGE engine.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cubert-badbone-pi"}
