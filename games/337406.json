Their collective conquests reduced the land to being split down the middle between their lands. In the coming years, both have dreamed of building themselves back up into great military powers to claim the rest of the land for themselves.\n\nHowever, their latest stalemate resulted in the death of Gothen\u2019s warlord, King Gustav. Morale in Gothen is low and must be corrected if they truly hope to get revenge on Birene. While Birene has been satisfied in turning itself into a trade empire, the surviving queen has been provided with an extreme measure for taking control\u2026 and she\u2019s ready to act on it.\n\nVia a thwarted attempt to put Birene into a state of array, the Birenian king\u2019s youngest son learns that the Gothen queen is ready to put them in their place. With the aid of his new public recruiting program, Prince Prosel must assemble a force to cut off the queen and put a stop to her desperate attempt. If he fails, she could do far worse to him and his nation than they have ever been able to do to her\u2026", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-shackled-power", "videos": [{"id": 145400, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gOxUc642ZTs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOxUc642ZTs", "title": "FEE3 2022: Shackled Power by Sphealnuke", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gOxUc642ZTs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
