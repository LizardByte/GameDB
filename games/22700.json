Live 30 seconds and grow old!\"\n\nAn arcade survival game with the goal of lasting 30 seconds in a room where various types of spinning bladed discs appear and bounce around, your only advantage is a short duration ability to slow down time.\nThere are 5 sets of 4 stages with a bonus stage unlocked if you survive 30 seconds in all 4. The next set of stages is unlocked based on the overall points collected.\nA total of 3 points can be collected for each normal stage, by surviving 10, 20 or 30 seconds,\n\nA re-imagined version of the game was revealed in 2020.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 9399, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rESjHcTW2OY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rESjHcTW2OY", "title": "DISC ROOM - Humble Original", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rESjHcTW2OY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
