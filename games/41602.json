The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlock-able combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgrade-able and can also be used to guard against an opponent's attack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-limited-edition"}
