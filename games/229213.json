One of the countries, Kradion, is largely frozen. Its people are famous for their mercenary soldiers and mechanical fighters. The other country, Welfrad, is prosperous and fertile. Kradion depends on imported food. When the great famine struck there was no food available and times were hard, so Kradion attacked Welfrad, all but destroying Welfrad's royal knight units. Just a few ace units survived because they were not in the capital when the attack came.\n\nAmong these is Ryuke, aka Blue Wing, chief knight of the royal army, who pilots the elemental fighter Huben Drake. The game starts with Ryuke separated from surviving units. He must survive and join his comrades to wage guerrilla war on the enemy.\n\nThe game consists of large-scale tactical battles, which are played on an isometrically viewed map, only part of which can be seen at once. There is a mini map in the lower left of the screen which shows the whole game area and the location of any other units, both friends and foe. During actual battles between units the game switches to a different view which displays the combat. As combat progresses the character collects experience points, special items, and additional special abilities.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-of-the-youstrass"}
