For it to meet your needs and inspire respect among competitors, you\u2019ll need money. The more money you earn, the better (and bigger!) a space fleet you\u2019ll be able to build, consisting of fast and maneuverable fighters, heavy bombers, and large transporters. All can be built according to your needs and customized to reflect your play style.\n\nMaking the right choices will be crucial to ensuring the success of your missions. Aside from choosing the best ship for the job, you\u2019ll need to manage resources usage, choose the best trading or smuggling routes, and even buy your own space stations that will allow you to explore the furthest corners of the galaxy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 48405, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EJg3tW2d5Yc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJg3tW2d5Yc", "title": "Space Commander: War and Trade - Nintendo Switch announcement trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EJg3tW2d5Yc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
