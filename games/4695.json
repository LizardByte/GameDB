These battles culminate in a face-off with the winner of the previous year's competition, Darkside, who drives a large armored car which fires multiple missiles at once.\n\nPlayers can choose one of 12 different vehicles with which to enter combat. Each vehicle has a distinct driver and special move. The controls consist of accelerator, brake, \"tight turn\" (essentially a handbrake) and turbo on the face buttons, with main weapons and machine gun selection and control on the shoulder buttons.\n\nArenas are populated with weapon pickups to re-supply missile stocks, repair stations for repairing damage to your car, pedestrians, and course stewards armed with either machine guns or missile launchers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twisted-metal", "videos": [{"id": 80381, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qQ0Lw80kXqw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ0Lw80kXqw", "title": "Twisted Metal - 1995 PlayStation Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQ0Lw80kXqw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 80382, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Dr7KeT7egH4"}]}
