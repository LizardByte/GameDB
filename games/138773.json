It was in the early morning when the chaos started: roaming hordes of bloodthirsty men ran through the city, killing everybody at sight. There were rumours about an army experiment and problems with the nuclear reactor. By 12 a.m., half of the city's population was part of the cannibal horde, about a thousand were killed in car accidents and by gunshots from personal firearms. U.S. Army forces moved into the city to rescue as many as possible. They soon had to realize that the only way to stop the cannibal hordes was to shoot them. Tanks entered the city and killed hundreds. At the same time Black Hawk squads searched for survivors. Survivors like you...", "summary": "BrainBread is a cooperative multiplayer experience built on the original Half-Life's GoldSrc engine. It features an arsenal of over 20 weapons makes sure you stand a chance of surviving against the zombie hordes - even if it's but a small one. You will need to help your friends to survive - the Zombies work as a team, and so you better do the same! You're not entirely alone, however. The Army is your only other ally. AI-based tanks, helicopters and soldiers will bring great AI vs. AI fights onto the streets.\n\nThe new GOREgeous-system allows you to shoot zombies into pieces and implements realistic blood particles, a seriously novel feature for an early Half-Life mod!\n\nAre you afraid of being killed by a zombie? One thing is worse: becoming one of them. Avoid getting bitten by those buggers. Hundreds of zombies, your friends, a bunch of weapons... are you ready for BrainBread?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brainbread", "videos": [{"id": 40449, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "i0aRTeieOqE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0aRTeieOqE", "title": "BrainBread Gameplay 1: Biodome", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i0aRTeieOqE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 82765, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FtsLeVIM-dc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtsLeVIM-dc", "title": "Brain Bread Beta 1 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FtsLeVIM-dc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
