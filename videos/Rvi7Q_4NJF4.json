You main objective of this game is to run away to escape the building as fast as possible, consisting of randomly-generated mazes starting from the southeast corner of the maze and exit through the northwest corner o the maze. To beat the game, you need the correct map (either true or false map), a compass that points in the opposite direction, and a pass to avoid being captured by the guards. \n\nNote: Wow! this game took me many tries before I can finally beat the game. This one of the earliest games that use a 3D 1st person perspective view and probably the first type of game released on the Apple II computer. Definitely a huge influence on 1st person shooter games in the 1990s.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rvi7Q_4NJF4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rvi7Q_4NJF4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rvi7Q_4NJF4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rvi7Q_4NJF4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rvi7Q_4NJF4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Apple ll Game: Escape!
