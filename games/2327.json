In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.\nEvery Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-party", "videos": [{"id": 36521, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "e8G5Aj8dMpk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8G5Aj8dMpk", "title": "Mario Party - Intro Nintendo 64 (HQ)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8G5Aj8dMpk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
