They lived in the time of British America, around the year 1830. They boasted an estate of four hectares where the rich landowner Mr. Benjamin Hudson owned a large number of slaves from the African continent, whom he tortured and raped in numerous occasions, provoking death.\nThe case never reached the courts since Hudson enjoyed great freedom thanks to the contacts he had previously obtained in political office. Because of this, the journalist James O'Connell must travel to the state of Louisiana, where a difficult task awaits him if he intends to bring to light all the mysteries that may have been hidden for more than a hundred years in that mansion.\n\nWill you be able to solve the Hudson family\u2019s best kept secret?", "summary": "This is a point and click mystery waiting to be solved by you!", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 19785, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8wzDGKvej24", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wzDGKvej24", "title": "The Mystery of the Hudson Case - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8wzDGKvej24/sddefault.jpg"}]}
