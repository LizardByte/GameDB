There's not much to do, no enemies to kill or puzzles to solve. You can just look around, interact with the things around you and take screenshots.\n\nEvery once in a while, though, a paper boat will come sailing and stop in front of your dock, carrying a message for you, written by a stranger. Maybe it's a kind word of encouragement, or somebody emptying their worries into the void.\n\nGood thing is that you can also send a message in your own paper boat, and let it sail for a stranger to read.\n\nWhen you need a small break from reality, you can just hang around on the dock, watch the day go by and read messages from strangers."}
