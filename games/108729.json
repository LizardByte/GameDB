Here you are surrounded by galaxies, suns and asteroids and move entire planets to get to your score. For an engulfing game experience Space 2048 includes a soundtrack and great sound effects. You can quit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off later. There is an undo for any mistakes you might make and you always have a history of your last 8 scores available.\n\nThe rules for the Space 2048 game are very simple. There are only four game moves. Use the arrow buttons or swipe on the screen to move to the left, the right, the top or the bottom. All planets will then move into that direction as far as they can. Planets of the same kind will merge into a new planet with their combined value and your score is updated. You win once you have one planet with the value of 2048. And that is much easier said then done.\n\nVisuals are a big part of the gaming experience and to match the overall theme all interface elements like the triple setting sound switch for example (full sound with background music, effects only or sound off) rotate floating in space. And while the true stars - pun intended - of Space 2048 are the planets with their magnificent slow rotation, they are more than matched in grandiosity by those fascinating backdrops. The latter are images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope with titles like \"Antennae Galaxies\" or \"Ring Nebula\"."}
