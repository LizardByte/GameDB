David Tveraas, Lead Designer, discusses the project in this video. \n\nEpic Games Page: https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/nightborn-e35c72\nSteam Page: [Pending Approval] \nKickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nightborn/nightborn\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/c/OccupationalHazard\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Z78uaQrxFJ\n\nTranscript: \n\n\"Greetings Creatures of the Night, \n\nI am David Tveraas, Unreal Engine 5 Game Designer and Worldbuilder.\n\nIt is with Great excitement and aplomb that I announce the development of Nightborn, an original IP Action RPG inspired by legendary games such as Deus Ex, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines, and Fallout: New Vegas.\n \nNightborn takes place in a Gothic version of our own world where you assume the role of a Vampire Detective known in vampire society as a Bloodhound. You will fight, sneak, and charm your way through the New Orleans underworld, to unravel a vast conspiracy involving vampire factions, werewolves, and far stranger supernatural creatures.  You will have to use your powers, gather allies, and solve mysteries if you wish to survive without losing yourself to madness or damnation. \n\nNightborn includes the following features:\n\u2022 Character Creation where you may choose to be descended from one of 10 ancient vampire lineages with their own identities and combination of dark powers\n\u2022 Lineage Powers include unnatural physical prowess, shapeshifting, controlling the minds of mortals, and blasphemous acts of eldritch sorcery.\n\u2022 As a vampire you must fuel your powers by preying upon mortals via stealth, seduction, or brute force. \n\u2022 To mask your dark nature, you must elude mortal law enforcement and monster hunters.\n\u2022 Solving the mysteries of gothic New Orleans will require taking quests, discovering clues, and exploring the supernatural underworld.\n\u2022 It would not be a vampire tale without underworld politics. You may side with the various Nightborn factions, such as the Ruling Establishment, the Reckless Libertines, the Fanatical Orthodoxy, or eschew them all to forge your own path.  \n\u2022 Connect with your dwindling humanity by engaging with mortals, recovering lost faith, or dancing in New Orleans Night Clubs.\n\nYou may support Nightborn by spreading the word about the project to your friends and on social media.
