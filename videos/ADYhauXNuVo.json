It's gone through many iterations, but I feel like I want to show off some of the work I've done on it. \n\nThe story of Untold Story: Rover comes from a snowy town, isolated from the rest of the world were Elements are a part of life. One day, a group of people appear inside an ancient shrine, and begin to activate a mysterious Monument. As the shrine begins to collapse, Rover and his friends are strangely teleported away to various locations around the world. \n\nRover is stranded alone, but soon gets saved by a friendly group calling themselves the Purple Pirates. From there, he sets out on a quest to find his other friends scattered across the world, but in the process, he meets several new people and learns more about the world that was hidden from him his entire life. They learn of a hidden monster, and Rover is tasked with defeating it once and for all, due to his unique ability of using the Elements. \n\nThis video starts off when Rover and his new allies, Roxy and Geoffrey, arrive in the Witch's Cave, finding a so-called Witch called Lazerous, as well as one of Rover's missing friends, Lexus. They proceed through the Witch's Cave, one of the first \"real\" dungeons [instead of a more simple and tutorial based dungeon] in the game. \n\nThis is still a work in progress, so I am aware of the many errors in the game, but it's certainly playable enough to get a good gist of the gameplay. Below is just a quick recap of the characters in the video:\n\nRover - The main character. He controls the Elements and his battle style revolves around using his Skills to exploit elemental weaknesses against enemies.\n\nRoxy - One of the Purple Pirates. Her main battle tactic is inflicting various status aliments on the enemies. \n\nGeoffrey - A Royal Guard of Telles. He is focused on Attacking, but can also alter the damage his allies or enemies take.\n\nLazerous - A self-called witch with \"Magic\" powers. Her strength lies in dealing Non-Elemental damage, allowing her to attack any enemy without fail.\n\nLexus - One of Rover's friends from his home town, Chilriva. She is a guest party member, and doesn't have much special about her.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADYhauXNuVo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADYhauXNuVo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADYhauXNuVo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADYhauXNuVo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADYhauXNuVo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Untold Story - Witch's Cave [WIP//Gameplay Video #1]", "description": "Untold Story is an RPG Maker VX Ace game I've been working on for nearly 5 years on and off.
