Swept up in a tropical storm, and then shipwrecked, you awake to find yourself on the beach of an uncharted desert island. Somehow, you must get off the island.\n\nAs your fantasy unfolds, you begin to explore a nearby cave, only to discover the diary of Alcemnon, the now-dead mariner who had lived on the isle years before. These few pages speak of mysterious places, magical artifacts and frightening creatures that are all part of the island. All the information therein will serve you in your search for Alcemnon's home, or something else, ultimately enabling you leave the island. Hidden tombs, a volcano that only magic can penetrate, and meandering subterranean caves and caverns are among the seven types of realms on the island. Some of these will offer you shelter, but be on your guard for what lurks and lives in the dark. Beware of flesh-eating Harrises, limbwrenching Satyrs and winged demons who kill with just a touch. More than these will try to end your search.\n\nBut all is not lost. Magical treasures, once in your possession, will lend you amazing powers. Penetrate the most secret of places using only a flute. Render yourself invisible with a fabulous cloak and make use of astounding magic formulas. If you use them wisely, these treasures will empower you to battle monsters, complete your search and victoriously leave Vulcan's Isle.", "summary": "Fantasy adventure with RPG elements.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/escape-from-vulcans-isle", "videos": [{"id": 105788, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cd4t_VgxxkA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4t_VgxxkA", "title": "Escape from Vulcan's Isle for the Atari 8-bit family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4t_VgxxkA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
