He christened it a land for mortals and tasked the Lesser Gods with carrying out His work. Yet when the Greater Being departed to oversee other worlds, discordance rose among the Lesser Gods.\n\nTwo factions formed: the Elders, who believed mortals should be allowed to live freely, and the Ancient Gods, beings from a cruel time who demanded total subservience.\n\nWords could not resolve this conflict, with the Ancient Gods threatening to undo the Greater Being\u2019s work. However, the Elders would triumph in this war, casting down the Ancient Gods.\n\nFearing that the Ancient Gods would one day return, the Elders constructed seven citadels, named Pillars. To protect from the vengeance of the Ancient Gods, these citadels were crafted from the bones of fallen Ancient Gods and thus imbued with their own powers.\n\nThe Elders hoped that, should their old enemies ever return, the Pillars would then protect all of the Ash Vales from harm.\n\nBut now, it is a perilous time for the Ash Vales\u2026\n\nThe lands of the Ash Vales have undergone catastrophic changes since the war of the Lesser Gods. Once flourishing territories are transformed into oppressive landscapes dotted with huge holes, hellish nightmares of soot and ashes poisoning nature, dangerous dark forests filled with fearsome creatures and poor lands suffering from bandit raids and demon attacks.\n\nOminously, as the Ash Vales have decayed, the magical protections protecting the Seven Pillars have failed. They are now open to be conquered by anyone who has the strength to take them, and all eyes are on the rich resource within: MagicCraft, or MCRT for short.\n\nMagicCraft is an ancient resource. Its primary use is to forge powerful weapons and armor. However, there is also a second use. Mortals can absorb MagicCraft into their souls, giving the user magical strength far beyond their normal abilities. In large enough quantities, MagicCraft can even form new life.\n\nThe mightiest Guilds across the Ash Vales now compete for this ancient power. So the Old Law has been invoked. \u201cLet any who lay claim to these treasures barter in steel and pay in blood.\u201d A Casus Belli for a declaration of war.\n\nFive major Guilds joined the fray \u2013 the Fallen, the Hunters, the Keepers of Arcana, the Betrothed, and the Nightbinders. Seeking MagicCraft to regain their former strength, resurrect their fallen gods and revive their lands , they are ready to fight. And here a new era of war begins.\n\nBut the Guilds are concerned. Fearing they lack the power for outright victory, they have been searching far and wide for new champions to ensure their domination will be complete.\n\nTheir search took them to deep and dark places, pouring over ancient texts of dark magic and powerful incantations. Here they discovered a long forgotten spell harnessing the power of the Seven Pillars to summon fighting champions from multiple dimensions to take up arms with them.\n\nOnly the strongest battle champions can help the Guilds, so thus the fighting pits were created. Great warriors, mages and fighting robots answered the call, tempted by the riches of MagicCraft offered as a bounty.\n\nThe victorious will enter the Ash Vales and battle for the ultimate reward. The time for talking is over. Let battle commence.", "summary": "MagicCraft is a PVP Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game (MOBA) launched on Binance Smart Chain, beginning as a quick action mobile game, with numerous play-to-earn opportunities, NFT characters and mini quests within each game.\n\nLaunching first with 15 main characters, each with different traits, skills, powers and abilities, the MagicCraft world is completely scalable, built to gradually expand from a MOBA game into a complex and challenging massively multiplayer metaverse experience.\n\nPlayers can enter battle as a single player, or form clans to fight in huge multiplayer battles, all for prizes in our native cryptocurrency, $MCRT.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magiccraft--1", "videos": [{"id": 77896, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "aqaLz2bMk5o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqaLz2bMk5o", "title": "MAGICCRAFT OFFICIAL TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aqaLz2bMk5o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77897, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "nqlqpT8WVCo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqlqpT8WVCo", "title": "MagicCraft Trailer for the Upcoming Beta Release || MagicCraftGame", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqlqpT8WVCo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77898, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LcncqSJA9fw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcncqSJA9fw", "title": "MagicCraft Multiplayer PvP Battle to Win $MCRT || MagicCraftGame Gameplay Footage [Part 2]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LcncqSJA9fw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77899, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pMJAkbuop70", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMJAkbuop70", "title": "PvP MOBA battle fury as Gamers Battle to Win $MCRT || MagicCraftGame Play2Earn Gameplay Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMJAkbuop70/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77900, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lfu39ezfLXc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfu39ezfLXc", "title": "MagicCraftGame Team Battle For $MCRT || MOBA PvP Gameplay Demo of Upcoming Beta Release", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lfu39ezfLXc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77901, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "Har9ro3Q0z0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Har9ro3Q0z0", "title": "Interview about MagicCraft with Igor Kovalev from Devoted Studios || MagicCraftGame", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Har9ro3Q0z0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
