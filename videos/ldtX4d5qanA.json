Embark on a journey alone or with friends to collect, craft, and outfit your wizard however you see fit as you explore the unknown.

Combine elements for intended or surprising effects that alter the shot, blast radius, bullet trail, and even the status of the creature in your crosshairs\n\nCustomized Whimsical Wizards\nCreate a dazzling wardrobe for your magic wielder from robes and hats to armor and accessories - functional and fashionable in a way that's sure to impress.\n\nRandomly Generated Biomes\nExplore and uncover new sections of the world filled with deserts, swamps, tundra, and prairies - all loosely floating together through space and time after the world was fractured. Unleash cosmic power from the safety of your tower to reset the world and emerge once again to find a new layout to once familiar lands.\n\nCooperative Adventuring\nSurvive alone or with up to four other wizards in online cooperative play to combine resources, magic, and creativity in your tower building. Or just watch it all burn down together - the choice is yours.\n\nSystemic Gameplay\nExperiment with new spell combinations and find out how they affect enemies and the world around you the hard way.
