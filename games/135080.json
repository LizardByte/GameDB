Local do-gooder Bill is standing obliviously in the street, smoking a self-rolled cigarette of what we'll assume is a legal substance. While consuming his cigarette's combusting contents, Bill is stung by a massive wasp. Like, no, seriously, a super big-ass wasp. Realizing his disdain for wasps, Bill sets out to eradicate the wasp scourge by attacking them with his mouth-based pellet shooting abilities.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-i-hate-wasps"}
