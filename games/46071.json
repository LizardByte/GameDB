It is the first in Puzzle & Action series, and has subsequently been ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear. Though the arcade version of Tant-R reached South Korea, the Mega Drive version remained exclusive to Japan and no versions of the game have ever made it to North America or Europe.\n\nTant-R borrows its graphical style from Bonanza Bros., and is therefore often seen as a spin-off. The two were paired with the game's sequel, Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. Tant-R was also paired with Quiz Shukudai wo Wasuremashita for a compilation on the Sega Saturn. A spinoff Saturn game \u2013 Sega Ages Vol.1 Shukudai ga Tant-R \u2013 was also made.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-and-action-tant-r", "videos": [{"id": 48759, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NMqHy1VxGvQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMqHy1VxGvQ", "title": "MD Puzzle & Action: Tant-R", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMqHy1VxGvQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
