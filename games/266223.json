Unwilling to let his cousin die, Kenshi rushed him to the nearest help: the Shirai Ryu.\n\nEven after Takeda was healed, Kenshi wouldn't release him. He feared that the Yakuza might kill him for failing his mission. Takeda resisted, attempting escape repeatedly.\n\nBut as the months passed, he began to appreciate the Shirai Ryu\u2019s selfless commitment to Earthrealm, and the contrast to his past lifestyle.\n\nInspired by the Shirai Ryu, Takeda swore to rip up Earthrealm's underworld by the roots. But he soon learns they are stronger and more tangled than he ever thought possible.", "summary": "Seeking to right the wrongs of his past, Takeda swears to rip up Earthrealm's underworld by the roots.\n\nThis pack includes playable character Takeda Takahashi, including all new move-sets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-1-takahashi-takeda", "videos": [{"id": 120704, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "dqZwGZBx-t8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZwGZBx-t8", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1 \u2013 Official Takeda Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqZwGZBx-t8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
