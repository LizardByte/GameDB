Ultimately when fighting her the most important thing is to watch out for and prepare for three particularly difficult spell cards she pulls off. You may start with very few resources, but this game\u2019s quite generous with them as you play through the game so it\u2019s not terribly difficult to stockpile for the more difficult attacks.\n\nCharacter: Suwako Moriya\nBoss: Manager Murasa\n\nMusic\n\n\u266a Dawn Moon And Double Cherry Blossoms by \u6850\u751f\nhttp://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm8840567\n\n\u266a FamilyMart Clerk Developed Intense Danmaku by \u6850\u751f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgHIBmukMM\n\n\u266a Song of the Blue Wind \u301c Twinkle Dream by \u6850\u751f\nhttp://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm10592339\n\nSpell Cards\n\n2:14 - Non-spell\n2:26 - Store Sign \"Franchise Scarlet\"\n2:40 - Non-spell\n2:52 - Entrance Sign \u201cAutomatic Door\u201d\n3:17 - Non-spell\n3:27 - Sale \u201cStore That Boils for You\u201d\n3:41 - Non-spell\n3:52 - Reading \u201cExteeeending Aaaaarm\"\n4:46 - Non-spell\n4:55 - Midnight \u201cOpen All Night All Week\u201d\n5:21 - Non-spell\n5:31 - \"Boundary of Manager and Part Timer\"\n6:07 - Non-spell\n6:29 - Bag Bringing \u201cSuper Economical\u201d\n6:42 - \"CHEEEEEEEN Store\"\n7:42 - \u201cFragrance of Famous Chicken\u201d\n\nYou can download the script here\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/file/zlazymm5dox/famima.zip", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFXqWoa2ZD8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFXqWoa2ZD8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFXqWoa2ZD8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFXqWoa2ZD8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFXqWoa2ZD8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u6771\u65b9\u5e97\u8217\u9332 \uff5e Combinations with you by \u9b6f\u920d\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3", "description": "\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude13\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude08\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\n\nThe fight against FamilyMart Murasa here is a bit of a tough one at first, but gets easier as you continue to do better against her.
