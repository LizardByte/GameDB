Following the disappearance of the Defender of the Universe, the Galactic Presidency has been dissolved and anarchy reigns. With the galaxy divided into three distinct zones, the Galactic Police and the Culthorpe pirate family are engaged in a cold war from across the Lifeless Zone. Life has never been more dangerous for the people of the universe, doubly so for those who make a living flying from planet to planet. And to make matters worse, an invisible conspiracy is threatening life itself.\n\nNone of which means anything to Daniel Gordon, earthling and wage slave, whose major concern is keeping hold of his pension plan. That is until he is unexpectedly abducted by the galaxy's premier employment agency and finds himself stuck with a crew of misfit mercenaries on a cargo transporter built more like a skip with thrusters. Will he get back to Earth in time for the meeting with his boss? Or will his adventure be cut short?", "summary": "Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment is a humorous adventure game following unwilling earthling Daniel Gordon in his adventures across space. The game features a mix of point-and-click adventure gameplay, a trading simulator, turn-based space battles, several minigames, and the odd ethical conundrum.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
