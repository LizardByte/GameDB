The title expands upon the activities available in the original, supplementing beach volleyball with additional beach-related minigames. DOAX2 features a two-week vacation mode, where the player can indulge in a variety of activities. Each day is broken up into three segments (morning, afternoon, and evening), where players can perform a single activity during each. The game puts a strong emphasis on friendship; players must befriend the other girls by buying them gifts they enjoy from the various stores on the island, playing pool-hopping and playing butt battles. Doing so will increase the bond between the two characters.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-or-alive-xtreme-2", "videos": [{"id": 5137, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "4HzfJcOCplQ"}]}
