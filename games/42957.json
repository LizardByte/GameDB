The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia in order to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.\n\nWhen Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of late Gallian national hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to Gallia's capital, Randgriz, and subsequently join the country's militia forces. Welkin is given the rank of lieutenant and assumes command of the newly-formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Initially, members of the squad question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience; however, he quickly earns their trust and loyalty with his tactical genius. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged.", "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered brings the World War II-inspired story, the beloved characters, and the mythology of the Valkyrur to life.

The Empire is sweeping through the continent like an unchecked wildfire and has its eyes set on the rich Ragnite deposits of the Principality of Gallia. Although peaceful Gallia remains neutral in the conflict, its citizens will need to defend home and country against the inevitable invasion. Players follow Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and the vaunted Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia as they take on the seemingly insurmountable forces of the Empire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-europa-edition", "videos": [{"id": 40485, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "CL_VFvVD9AI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL_VFvVD9AI", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered - Story Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CL_VFvVD9AI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40486, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "2q3BKconDkQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q3BKconDkQ", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered - Battle Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2q3BKconDkQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40483, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "rXJyXaD_Izw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJyXaD_Izw", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered - Announcement Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rXJyXaD_Izw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40484, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "l8KlNhp6ko8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8KlNhp6ko8", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8KlNhp6ko8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
