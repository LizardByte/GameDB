They believe in a vision of freedom and justice for all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or creed. They wage a war against The System that controls the wealth and power of the society, and they try to rally the masses to join their cause and their movement.\nBut The System is not willing to give up without a fight. It employs its most loyal and skilled agents, the elite police force, to crush The Stagers and their movement. The System permits agents to \u201cShoot on Sight\u201d anyone who is suspected of being a rebel or supporting them.\nThe Stagers are not afraid of death. They are determined to strike at the heart of The System and bring it down. They launch a series of attacks on key targets that will weaken The System\u2019s grip on the people. These are the final and most crucial battles, where both sides will risk everything for their ideals.\nWho will win in this epic struggle between The Stagers and The System?", "summary": "Shoot On Sight is a multiplayer isometric fast paced tactical shooter (PVP & PVE 4V4) in which strategy, tactics, plans and every communication matters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shoot-on-sight", "videos": [{"id": 104153, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3qG8ncrFzgw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qG8ncrFzgw", "title": "Shoot On Sight \u2013 1st Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qG8ncrFzgw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
