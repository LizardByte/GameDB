The game was originally created in English, but it has been hand translated to Japanese.\nExtra endings, a more non-linear style of play, and extra plot unlock after you complete the first play-through! (You must play the game a second time to see a lot of the content! Don't miss out! The control key skips already seen lines!)\n30-45 whole minutes of gameplay in total!\nCompleted endings list, with 3 endings.\nAdmittedly rough RPG battles, most of which can be skipped on replay.\nA terrifying combination -- inspired by Undertale, Earthbound, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, and various other things. Mostly Undertale, though.\nRandomized events and dialogue... Each time you play something might subtly change!\nTwo separate gay couples on the True Ending route.\nA nameable Protagonist if you enable it in the options\nAbsolutely 0 (zero) references to COVID-19 as this predates it by a whole year.\nBut wait!
