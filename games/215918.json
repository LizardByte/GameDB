All governments have merged into one world order, and all services and goods are handled by a sole corporation known as Wally Monopolies Conglomerate. Due to the overpopulation of Earth, the newly formed world government seeks to colonize Mars. Upon arrival, the Earthlings come across the native Martians, which are opposed to Earth's invasion. A war ensues, leaving Earth's forces decimated. Seeing an opportunity for wealth; the head of WMC, known as Wally, agrees to fund the World military if they become a subsidiary of Wally's monopoly. With the Earth Government in the red, and humanity on the brink of destruction, Earth's world order agrees, making Wally the sole owner of Earth. With Wally's wealth, Wally's military conquers Mars. Now with Martian technology, Wally seeks to take over the universe.\n\nYears later, Wally has acquired a vast majority of the known universe, the thrill of conquering worlds has diminished. Now Wally wishes to create, rather than destroy. He seeks to focus his wealth on creating a world of his own. The player takes on the role of a WMC employee, or \"Wally Cadet\", in which they gather resources from other worlds and dimensions to help in Wally's new endeavor.", "summary": "VOSS Turbo is a retro styled, on rail, twin stick shooter with controller and keyboard support.
