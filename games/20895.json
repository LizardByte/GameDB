Expect surreal environments as you transform between three different materials to push boxes, spheres, and other objects to clear a path towards the end. Pre-placed \"Transformers\" will turn your ball into either Paper, Wood, or Stone, each with their own downsides and advantages.\n\nPaper can, for example, use gusts of wind to reach higher elevations, fall slower than the other materials, and get around quickly. Stone may be required to push heavy materials, but, due to its immense weight, will experience different issues when trying to navigate environments. Wood is the neutral material of choice: it rolls reliably and quickly, allowing it to stick to sideways railing while still being able to push objects of a medium density.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ballance", "videos": [{"id": 71374, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BeS_OOf4tyk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeS_OOf4tyk", "title": "Ballance - Gameplay [4K]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeS_OOf4tyk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
