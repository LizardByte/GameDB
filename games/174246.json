Faerie Alchemy is a more than a match-3 puzzle game. It is simple to understand with deep complexity to master as you aim for higher heights of elements and score. To play Faerie Alchemy, the player drops two elemental pieces at a time into the game board. As three or more elements combine, the elemental pieces group together to form an elemental piece of the next highest quality at the lowest left area of the game board where the original group occupied. The strategy is in dropping pieces in ways which ensure cascades into higher and higher elemental tiers."}
