As the game starts you will have to duke it out against the opposing paddle, using the fluid as your weapon.  To do this you can shoot plasma out of the paddle to push the fluid around, which in turn pushes the ball around.  Another weapon at your disposal is the ability to suction fluid back into your paddle. By doing this, possession of the ball can be controlled by the player.  Once the ball is fully sucked into the paddle you can blast the ball across to the opposing player side.  The power of the suction, and its blast, is determined by a meter at the top of the screen.  If you hold on too long, you risk losing the ball.  After scoring against the opponent, you will level Up\u30fband the game mechanics will become harder.  The ball will be more reactive to the fluid, making it much more unpredictable. Lose the ball and you will lose a life. Lose 10 lives and its game over.  Good Luck!\n\n\nMusic: ES Posthumus - Pompeii\n Harry Gregson-Williams - Training Montage", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGJO5bydch4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGJO5bydch4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGJO5bydch4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGJO5bydch4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGJO5bydch4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Plasma Pong Gameplay", "description": "Disclaimer: If you are prone to epilepsy, please stay away from this game.\n\nOne of the most entertaining games I've played in awhile.\n\nSorry if I was messing around on the title screen for a long time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nPlasma Pong is a variant of the popular PONG game, with a high tech twist \u30fbit uses computational fluid dynamics to drive the environment.
