Over 1,800 original movie-themed questions are available across two game modes: Play Now and Party Play. Packaged along with the game are four custom wireless controllers featuring large colored buttons so players can quickly submit or \"buzz-in\" a multiple-choice answer before their opponents.\n\nFeatured categories include Child's Play, where a child's artwork is used to depict a movie scene; Quotables, where part of a film's dialogue is missing; Puzzle Picture, which scrambles an actor's image; Invisibles, where actors and other items have been removed from a scene; and Clip Study, which has players answering questions about a short clip. The game automatically keeps track of which questions have been already asked to minimize repeats.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scene-it-lights-camera-action", "collections": [{"id": 762, "name": "Scene It?"}]}
