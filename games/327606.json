If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minesweeper--9"}
