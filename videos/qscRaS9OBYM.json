New Day's Early Access does NOT contain EVERYTHING that the game will have in it. Only around 14% of what we envision the final game to look like. It's mainly here to serve as a concept to what the future holds. Updates for Early Access can be found in the Discord.\n\nYes, this trailer is dramatic on purpose.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/NewDay408\nDemo: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2428440/New_Day/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Xw24MATkun\n\nIf you'd like to help New Day and are a modeler, we need environmental, prop, and hairstyle modelers. Contact me on Discord if you're interested! This also applies to 3D animators.\n\nDiscord Username: sexyfurbies\n\nNew Day does not have an official, final release date yet.\n\nNew Day is a Tomodachi Life x The Sims experience that combines factors of both games into one!
