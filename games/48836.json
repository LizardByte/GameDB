As with the first game, the goal is to help a sentient pachinko ball named Pachio-kun bankrupt a series of pachinko parlors and liberate all his miniature brethren from their flashy mechanical gulags.\n\nThe game introduces Pachio-kun's wife, presumably named Pachio-chan. If she's upset about her husband's gambling addiction, she never shows it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachio-kun-2"}
