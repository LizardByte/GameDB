Played on hard, music done by Antestor (not part of the game, there's not supposed to be any music aside from the main menu.)\nThis was a Christian game on the Quake 1 engine. To fit the game we added some \"Christian\" black metal in the background cause Quake fits perfectly with black/death metal, and it's Christian. So... yeah. ;P Also some of the intro text was skipped unintentionally. We believe this is an issue with the speed of newer OS, and this will be tested on Win9x in the future.\nIt was in fact a commercial game, distributed strictly through mail order back in 2002 and 2003 with the exception of a local Christian store. In 2004 it was released as freeware and the one store that had it was instructed to destroy all their remaining copies. A review/unboxing/history video will be done in the coming months by one of our personal channels \"Retrodeath Reviews\".\n\nAnd while Christian games usually are not designed very well at all and always sell super poorly (hence why they haven't been made in over a decade),  this is probably the only exception of it being an actually pretty well designed and fun to play game, despite it really not being much more than a quake/hexen 2 mashup mod.
