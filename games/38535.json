Up to 4 four players could play a single game playing alternately. The controls feature a trackball which is used to control both direction and power, and two buttons which control left and right spin or hook.\n\nThe game was released in both upright cabinet and latterly as a cocktail version. Most of the upright cabinet are conversion kits for existing cabinets although a limited number of dedicated cabinets were produced. These cabinets featured a birch plywood finish to mimic a bowling lane, a larger marbled trackball and painted side art.\n\nAn alternate version, Coors Light Bowling, was released the following year.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/capcom-bowling", "videos": [{"id": 39486, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7vNEJWAbhsI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vNEJWAbhsI", "title": "Capcom Bowling (Arcade) - Game Play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7vNEJWAbhsI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
