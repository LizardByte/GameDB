This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.", "summary": "Gremlins, Inc. is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige.
