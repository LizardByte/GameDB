When compared to the Battle Gear 3, there are certain features changed in this game.\n\n* The addition of European models (for example, Volkswagen Golf and Renault Clio (Lutecia) V6) and the European stages (with notable examples of the Monaco track and Monte Carlo Rally) representing a departure from Initial D.\n\n* The Takumi Mode in Battle Gear 3 is removed. Instead, a severe speed penalty is implemented into the system, forcing the player to use the brakes.\n\n* A more extensive tuning system is available to the key users. Instead of simply modding the external parts, the performance hardwares are available as well this time. These can be performed in the online virtual garage.\n\n* A player can also activate the \"Garage Extension\" functions. This includes the benefit of having a team, customizing decals, vinyls and setting names and such.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-gear-4", "videos": [{"id": 137174, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KJ91n_rgW48", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ91n_rgW48", "title": "Battle Gear 4 Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
