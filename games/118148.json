It was inspired by classic fantasy action games (Golden Axe, Rastan) where hero fights hordes of enemies. In Voracious however, the story is more important than the thrill of simple combat. This is not a story about revenge or treasure hunting but a story about humanity\u2019s worst traits \u2013 greed and lust for power. The art style goes further into simplicity than common retro pixel games. It uses ultra-simple black and white vector graphics.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/voracious", "videos": [{"id": 27046, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "gJcM6izK5sQ"}]}
