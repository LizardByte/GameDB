{"id": "alAekHsSiOg", "snippet": {"title": "GLUT (full game play-through)", "description": "This is a full game play-through of the video game, GLUT (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva\n\nfor more information, go to http://glut.website\n\nGLUT (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva, is an inquiry into the knowings and unknowings of embodiment. It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which manifests as both an immersive physical installation and videogame. The core of GLUT is a sound composition made entirely of Hedva\u2019s voice, ranging from its rawest expression of screams, to two AI vocal clones that, in order to trick the surveillance tactics embedded in AI, have been manipulated to sound ever more de-human.\n\nDisturbed that proprietary vocal-clone software services reserve the right to sell client voice data to governments and corporations, Hedva worked with artist, musician, technologist, and writer Jessika Khazrik to deceive the software, training it with Hedva\u2019s voice disguised through multiple vocoding processes. Hedva and Khazrik created two vocal clones: Arid and Mud, neither of which are made from an actual human voice and therefore not actual vocal clones. In GLUT, these two AI voices speak a text corpus that Hedva built over four lunar cycles, and synthesized through various divination techniques. The corpus is composed of the writings of medieval mystics (mostly of the apophatic tradition); theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers writing about black holes, dark matter, night, and nothingness; poets and novelists on sleep, music, and the voice; and the algorithm of amazon.com.\n\nOne of the provocations of GLUT is the question of whether Amazon, in predicting our desires and shaping our future, is our latest divining tool, a kind of contemporary mysticism.\n\nThe physical installation of Glut spatializes the sound in a subtly eerie, immersive room, large enough for one person only, which has been built into the existing architecture of the HKW Berlin. With a simple bed covered in Anti-Fatigue Foam (a material made specifically to trick workers into not noticing the exhaustion of their bodies), the installation draws on the dissociated \u201cvoid room\u201d settings in films like Get Out and Under the Skin, a little pocket of a universe that amplifies the limits of the body by simultaneously erasing them. But the goal here is not for the viewer to transcend the walls, but instead to feel them acutely. In this sense, it's a deceptive sensory deprivation chamber, a narrow closet in Hell.\n\nIn the Glut videogame, users are a teratoma avatar that drags itself through an environment cheating at non-Euclidean geometry through a series of nesting black holes, intestinal tunnels, glittering caves, and oceans of black water. The videogame is a digital experience that mirrors the physical installation while producing a world that disorients as much as it confirms what knowledges are available to the body.\n\nThe physical installation is not permanent nor wheelchair accessible, nor comfortable for some in light of COVID, nor for those with claustrophobia. Because of this Hedva developed the video game, with sign language versions in both ASL and BSL, as well as audio description, which will be available indefinitely. All aspects of the digital version, including accessibility features and this website, were produced by Shape Arts as part of the Adam Reynolds Award Programme, supported by Arts Council England and Garfield Weston Foundation.\n\nIn all of its iterations, GLUT is rooted in the premise that AI has existed long before computers in the forms of divination and mysticism, and following this premise, GLUT asks what, how, and where we can know and un-know what we think we do.\n\nThe physical installation of Glut is part of the group exhibition, Illiberal Arts, at HKW Berlin, curated by Anselm Franke and Kerstin Stackemeier, on view 11 September - 21 November, 2021.\n\nCredits\u2014\nJohanna Hedva\u2014concept, direction, vocal performances, divination, and texts\nHot Knife Digital Media\u2014game development\nJessika Khazrik\u2014sound and speech co-conspirator, score composition and production, machine learning and mixing\nJohannes Beck\u2014visual co-conspirator and architect of physical installation\nSam Lavigne\u2014website\nEverest Pipkin, Sam Lavigne, Casey Reas, Jessika Khazrik\u2014AI consultation\nAndy Healy\u2014production consultation\nCandace Davider\u2014American Sign Language\nNikki Champagnie Harris\u2014British Sign Language\nSupported by Shape Arts, HKW Berlin, Arts Council England, and Garfield Weston Foundation.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/alAekHsSiOg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/alAekHsSiOg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/alAekHsSiOg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "GLUT (full game play-through)", "description": "This is a full game play-through of the video game, GLUT (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva\n\nfor more information, go to http://glut.website\n\nGLUT (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva, is an inquiry into the knowings and unknowings of embodiment.
