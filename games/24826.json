The player controls a space ship with a simple task: kill all alien invaders. The ship is restricted to horizontal movement on the lower part of the screen - while the enemy formation sticks to the same movement pattern, occasionally one or more ships break out and attack the player directly. If they (or one of their shots) hits the player ship, one of the three lives is lost. Additional lives are earned after 7000 points are earned or after a set amount of levels is passed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galactic-chase"}
