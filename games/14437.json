All that exists is you and the world. Set in a decaying city from a civilization long past, The Old City: Leviathan puts the player in the shoes of a sewer dwelling isolationist. You progress through the narrative by simply exploring the world. The story itself is told via the musings of your character and, chiefly, the environment itself. This environment has been designed to be diverse, interesting, and meaningful to the narrative of the game.\n\nThe objective is to understand. The story of The Old City: Leviathan is not told in a traditional manner. As you progress through the narrative, you will overhear a conversation between two entities. The first entity is the nameless character you are controlling who communicates through a monologue. The second entity is the depths of the environment, details and all. Your task is to piece together the narrative as if you are jumping into a conversation with no context. The more you explore, the more you will potentially understand.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-old-city-leviathan", "videos": [{"id": 6192, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bIU3t2AocnQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIU3t2AocnQ", "title": "The Old City: Leviathan - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bIU3t2AocnQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6193, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "-31bgbE08Cs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-31bgbE08Cs", "title": "The Old City: Leviathan | Walkthrough Gameplay | Part 1 (Commentary 1080p)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-31bgbE08Cs/sddefault.jpg"}]}
