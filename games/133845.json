Set forth as a new adventurer and explore this vast planet and harvest more biological material. \n \nBring the biological material and any other ores you find back to the Orbiter to upgrade your equipment. Be cautious as the more you destroy and harvest the planet, the more deadly and abundant the creatures of the world become. \n \nListen to your robot companion as they are very knowledgeable. \n \nSet forth and explore!", "summary": "Terrene is a new sequel to the Sci-Fi action game Evidence of Life, it is created by Justwall Games and Albatross Wirehead. Terrene is a retro action adventure game with survival elements. You explore a giant procedural world to complete your mission tasks. Freely fly your ship from your orbiting space station down to the planets surface and disembark to play on foot and explore vast cave systems. \n \nMine ores then store them on your ship to deliver to the oribiter. Once delivered you can use them to upgrade your player, weapons and ship. Your tasks include gathering a set amount of bio material from the planets fauna and foliage, harvesting the planet hearts (bosses), and finding hidden alien relics. The more you harvest the planet the more alien threat will increase unlocking different enemy types and increasing danger on the planet. \n \nTerrene is part survival game. You have limited oxygen on the surface, explore as much as you can before returning to your ship. Upgrade your player to increase your oxygen so you can spend more time and dig deeper. Player health can only be restored by harvesting planet fauna. Dying will return you to your ship and leave behind a backpack that you will need to retrieve to get your inventory back. Dying again will mean the backpack is lost forever. \n \nUse certain ores types to unlock and upgrade different primary and secondary weapons. Weapons to unlock include, rifle, shotgun, sniper lazer, and flame thrower. Secondary weapons include grenades, shield, mines and cluster mines. Homing missiles and bombs can be unlocked for your ship. Choose which weapons you prefer and spend your upgrades however you see fit. \n \nThe Terrene world is procedurally generated by a seed of your choosing, it is 5000 blocks wide and is made up of ten different randomly generated biomes. Each biome contains its own plant and rock types, procedural textures, its own enemy spawn set, ore spawn rates and landscape style. Use your ship to quickly traverse the landscape, and set down wherever you would like to explore. The in game mini map uncovers where you have you explored to help keep track of where you have been.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terrene", "videos": [{"id": 35853, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AlmS7O2Xxy4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmS7O2Xxy4", "title": "Terrene - An Evidence of Life Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AlmS7O2Xxy4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
