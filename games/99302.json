Play as The Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, inquisition, witch-hunting, and join The Grand Tournament. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don\u2019t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow. All that, spiced up with an inappropriate Monty Python inspired sense of humor.\n\nRustler\u2019s world is filled with humor, anachronisms, and pop culture references. Ever been towed for parking in a \u201cNO HORSE ZONE\u201d? Wanna do some cage fights in Medieval Martial Arts Arena? Or maybe pimp-a-horse a little? How about joining the Round-Earthers sect?\n\nAs a poor peasant, you really need to get creative in order to win the Grand Tournament. Form weird alliances, double-cross your foes, and dig up dinosaur skeletons in a light, easy-to-understand, and hard-to-empathize-with story.", "summary": "Become a medieval thug in a crazy open-world action game, full of pop-culture references.
