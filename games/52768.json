Stack the falling triangles to create bigger triangles of the same color making them disappear along with the black background. A very simple concept, but doing it for an entire level requires quick memory, clever strategy, and great dexterity. Only a TRIANGULATE MASTER can complete all nine levels, especially the final three which will require incredible skill and patience."}
