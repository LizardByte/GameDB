It is also interesting to play by choosing from 4 difficulty levels by yourself, and to challenge how many questions you can clear within the time limit. In addition, you can register up to 100 questions, so you can copy the questions in the newspaper and play with them, or you can create your own original questions. In addition, the two-player battle mode is also fulfilling. In \"Point Battle\", you can use the item panel, and you can play while bargaining, such as \"chain\" and \"quick placement\". In \"speed battle\", you compete for which one has cleared many problems in the same time. Of course, there is plenty of support for beginners. You can proceed while learning the rules in the hands-on tutorial.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-series-vol-1-sudoku"}
