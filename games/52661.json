Flipping the ball inside the Mod and Kart caverns changes the background of the table, with different designs keeping the board fresh.\n\nThe table stays true to its source material. A countdown before the ball is launched awards you with some bonus points if you time it correctly, and the love it or hate it theme tune returns to drive the action. The table's main point of interest is a series of rails at the top, which need to be hit frequently to award bonuses.\n\nAside from the changing character models though, the grey tarmac background is a little plain and disappointing, especially for a game with as much personality as Modnation Racers.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-heroes-modnation-racers", "videos": [{"id": 39436, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CWaSs8MPprU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWaSs8MPprU", "title": "Pinball Heroes: ModNation Racers - Extra Ball", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWaSs8MPprU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
