There are plenty of basketball games out there, but none with the hands-on control of Mario Hoops 3-on-3. Players use the touch screen to get their game on as they execute tricky dribbles, special passes and sweet shots - all with strokes and taps of the stylus. Players choose their teams of three characters from the Mario universe and hit the parquet. Power-ups like Red Shells and Bob-ombs can turn the tide as they chase down coins - they will affect the score, so players collect as many as they can as they drive to the hoop. Whether playing against friends on a local wireless connection, jamming through a tournament or just playing mini-games, there's a mode for everyone.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-hoops-3-on-3", "videos": [{"id": 20853, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "GXtkD8r1yzE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXtkD8r1yzE", "title": "Nintendo DS Longplay [067] Mario Hoops 3 on 3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
