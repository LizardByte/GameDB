If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 47179, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-h8K5G_-FVk"}, {"id": 47180, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kgbZwK1t7qI"}]}
