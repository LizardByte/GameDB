To improve the usability and balance in all aspects of gameplay, without removing options or impeding on personal preference whenever possible. (classes, items, etc.)\n2. To reduce the necessity of grind and other tedious aspects of the game. (faster JP gain, easier class unlocks, better poaches, etc.)\n3. To streamline the game's difficulty so that it remained challenging to a player who previously played FFT, without forcing optimization or any extraneous leveling.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
