It's relentlessly charming and pathologically upbeat, with lead characters that are so instantly loveable if you dropped pictures of them on a desert island whose inhabitants had no contact with society you would be guaranteed a dragon-centric Cargo Cult within seven days. The original port of the game to the Amstrad CPC, however, was inarguably one of the poor relations of the franchise. It lacked the spirit that made the arcade version so great, and it is an unadulterated pleasure to play a new, shiny port of the game that shows what could have been done with more time and effort. Bubble Bobble for the CPC, abbreviated concisely by the developer into BB4CPC, underlines the excellence that can be achieved by one person working alone on a labour of love, for absolutely ages, without the pressures of working in a commercial development environment with deadlines, managers and budget restraints. The bangs and whistles, the panache and the cuteness, the occasional fiendish difficulty and the pathologically infectious theme tune are all there in spades.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bubble-bobble-4-cpc", "videos": [{"id": 107339, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KX3QqS-THAs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX3QqS-THAs", "title": "BB4CPC - Amstrad CPC Homebrew", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KX3QqS-THAs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
