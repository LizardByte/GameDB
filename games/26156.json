The game is about getting from one side of the screen to the other without dying. This might sound easy enough but a single touch from a spike will instantly kill you and send you back to the start of the level. \nAll levels consists of a single static screen filled with hazards. If you think you have what it takes, give it your best shot. This game is not to be considered easy. \n\nThe story is told with the help of signs placed in the levels and it progresses as you complete levels and get further. If you rather just focus on the gameplay you can ignore the story all together, the choice is yours. \n\nThe recommended input method is a good gamepad/controller but keyboard works just as well if you prefer it. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGAME FEATURES\n\nChallenging Gameplay \nLevel Editor with workshop integration \nPlay user created levels \nAchievements \nLeaderboards \nCloud saves (cross platform) \nJumping \nFull Gamepad Support (Xbox 360 tested) \nAuto Save System (Continue on level you quit on) \nA Bar \nBooze Powerups (Dont drink & drive kids) \nVaried Level Design", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jumper-jape", "collections": [{"id": 2537, "name": "Jumper Jape"}]}
