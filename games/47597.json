Bets are placed just prior to the start of the race, different horses have different odds, and then the race begins. Some rather impressive Motion Capture graphics were used for the animation of the horses. After the race is over the winning horse is declared in a slow motion photo finish and the winning bets are paid. Again, the game can be set to \"pay out\" to either an installed coin hopper, or through a \"credit\" re-imbursement system set-up by the location or the operator. The Jockey Grandprix cartridge came complete with a harness cable and settings explanation sheet for just that purpose.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jockey-grand-prix"}
