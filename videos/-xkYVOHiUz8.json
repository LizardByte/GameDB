The installer doesn't work on Windows 10.\n...\nOne of my childhood game collections had 3 Stuart Little games, only one of them being for all ages, this and another one (will be in the next video) are for preschoolers. I think I played them at around the age of 10 so I was already too old for this one but I played it anyway, the next one is... a bit of a different case...\nFor some reason this game is prone to crashing. When I used to play it on a legitimate Windows XP, it was stable, except I could NEVER get into this room: 1:44, so at least now I can access this part of the game.\nI was wondering why movements were messed up, but changing the Mouse Integration setting fixed it.\n4:15 I had a brainfart, too long of a story to explain.\nBy the end of this footage there are 2 sections of the brain that are still completely empty. I think I have to finish the coloring minigame to access one, but I don't remember what these leftover minigames were.\n50:30 I also don't remember if I'd ever been here.\nNow I have questions that never really hit me when I was so much younger. Why does Bee look like... this? And are these just random eduntainment games with Stuart Little shoehorned in for whatever reason? I mean, look at him, then look at the rest of the game, he visually doesn't fit in... When I was really small, I watched the live-action films on VHS tapes. In one of them, he nearly drowned in a washine machine by accident. And years later I came to... this?
