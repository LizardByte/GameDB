In the heart of Neon Bastion, a cyber-megalopolis powered by quantum energy, The Rift was meant to be a limitless energy source. Instead, it became a doorway to something else\u2014a fractured dimension of unstable physics, rogue AI war machines, and entities beyond human comprehension.\n\nWhen the Rift opened, the Quantum Surge rewrote the rules of reality. Buildings twisted, time fractured, and matter collapsed into energy. The city\u2019s infrastructure became a shifting battleground where enemies phase in and out of existence, and physics itself is an unstable weapon.\n\nNow, YOU, an elite Quantum Striker, are humanity\u2019s last line of defense. As part of The Rift Vanguard, an experimental strike force, your mission is simple: contain the anomaly, neutralize the invaders, and prevent the total collapse of reality.\n\nBut every battle changes you. The quantum energy seeps into your body, granting enhanced reflexes, teleportation abilities, and gravity-defying combat tactics. The more you fight, the less human you become. Are you still a soldier, or are you evolving into something\u2026 more?", "summary": "Step into the future with Quantum Strike, a high-octane Mixed Reality VR shooter where the world around you warps and transforms in real time!
