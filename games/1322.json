Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on...\nYou are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.\n\nBut then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!\nYou see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to Dreaming will open!\n\nNow, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!\n\nDon't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!", "summary": "G'day, Mate. Explore the wilds of Australia with TY the Tasmanian Tiger, the charming Aussie platformer. Stone the crows! Are you ready to explore the wilds of the Australian Outback in this remastered version of the classic game, TY the Tasmanian Tiger?\n\nJoin TY on a ripper of an adventure to free his family from the dreaming and stop the nefarious evil genius boss cass from removing mammals from the top of the food chain.\n\nTo help you on your quest, you've got a beaut arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger", "videos": [{"id": 69704, "name": "TV Commercial", "video_id": "qzsC1qSqFDo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzsC1qSqFDo", "title": "Ty The Tasmanian Tiger Tv Commercial Trailer 2002", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qzsC1qSqFDo/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 290, "name": "Ty the Tasmanian Tiger"}]}
