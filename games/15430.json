Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three, with the fourth serving as a \"Striker\", a fighter whose function is only to enter a match, attack the opponent and leave without replacing their teammates. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-99-millennium-battle"}
