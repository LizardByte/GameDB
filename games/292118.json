The game uses software called TurboSound to produce voice through the PC speaker, while the vast majority of games required a soundcard. There are three modes of play. In the first mode, the game announces a letter, which the player must find on the keyboard, and then an object that starts with that later is introduced and drawn onto the screen. In the second mode, the player can press any letter and the corresponding object is drawn to the screen, which the player can move wherever they want. In the third mode, three letters and three objects are displayed, and the player must draw a line between the letters and objects to make them match. Registered users received a copy of the game which displayed their child's name, and could request a CGA optimized version which was much faster for CGA users. Additionally, they were promised a free game. Later versions promised a copy of Millions of Mazes, which may or may not have been the original free game.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/talking-abcs-a-day-at-the-beach", "videos": [{"id": 109514, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KPPLTtD33rg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPPLTtD33rg", "title": "Talking ABC's: A Day at the Beach Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KPPLTtD33rg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
