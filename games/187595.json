He is talented and intelligent, but he has one terrible drawback \u2013 he is unbearably alone.\nBut soon, Josiah will have a fateful encounter that will turn his whole life and make him break the shell he used to live in. A meeting with someone or, perhaps, something that is hidden in such depths that even the horrific City cannot reach them. Something so secret that the very knowledge of it can be deadly. Something truly monstrous.", "summary": "Deep beneath the surface of the dead Earth, the City, the last refuge of humanity, hides.
