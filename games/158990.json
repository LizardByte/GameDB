The goal of the game is to travel down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way. The Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him at times.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 69122, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Bre8DfFLWwg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bre8DfFLWwg", "title": "SNES Longplay [295] Taz Mania", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bre8DfFLWwg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
