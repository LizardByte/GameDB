Just after Ash conquered the Indigo League he got back to his mom in his hometown where Professor Oak has a new objective for him. He wants Ash to go to Valencia Island to pick up a strange kind of Pokeball for him, since Professor Ivy is unable to send it to him through the PC system. Of course Ash is eager to take this easy objective. What happens after this is, of course, already known to you because we all saw the anime. Nearly all episodes on the Orange Islands are covered, but not all events are necessarily very prominent. Some episodes are implemented as an important part of the storyline, while some are just miniquests.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-orange-islands", "videos": [{"id": 101754, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "4WqK2moYXH0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WqK2moYXH0", "title": "Pokemon Orange Islands Part 1 PokeFan Choose Pokemons (Running Shoes & Town Map) | GBA Rom Hack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4WqK2moYXH0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
