The super Battlecruiser Atlas was sent to the region to construct spaceport facilities, but was seized by a deadly weapon. The marines have been called back to save the ship, but the infection is becoming more entrenched. The final dropship has been sent, carrying a group of 5 battle hardened space marines.\n\nDerelict is a first person shooter and a tactical action game inspired by Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels. The player controls a group of 5 space marines in two ways: directly in first person view (with the keyboard and mouse) or by giving them orders via map view (primarily with the mouse). Each marine has its own skills and abilities:\n- Communications: the communications specialist can see enemies in the map screen.\n- Heavy Assault: carries a belt fed Gatlin Cannon which doesn't need to be reloaded.\n- Demolition: the demolition expert carries a modified rifle with a grenade launcher attached, which power can rip apart obstacles and temporarily disrupt teleportation systems.\n- Engineer: carries automated tools to repair doors and can hack security system faster than the other marines.\n- Medic: can heal the other team members and has a hazard suit which allows him to walk through dangerous areas.\n\nThe player can switch among the marines any time by pressing the proper hot keys or using the mouse wheel. While controlling a marine, the others will be AI controlled.\n\nThe game has a total of 20 levels and five difficulty ranks, from private to general, and the harder the rank, the more frequently enemies respawn, the quicker they move and the slower the medic heals.\n\nRelease Date: July 6, 2008\nGenre: Survival Horror, First-Peron Shooter, Strategy\nPlatforms: Windows\n\n--Development Team--\nConcept:\nErik Hogan\n\nDesign:\nErik Hogan\n\nProgramming:\nErik Hogan\n\nAdditional Level Design:\nSam Jeffreys, Miika Vihersaari\n\nSound Design:\nKristie Addison\n\nAdditional Music:\nSamuel Gavin, Edward Clombe, Bill Norris, Krystian Krewniak\n\n3D Models:\nMark Harper (for 3D Gun Models), Craig Nisbet (for misc furniture objects), The Game Creators for 3D Animated Characters, Geometrics for Space Ship\n\nCast:\nSam Jeffreys (Communications), Jonathan McCarthy (Assault), Steve Godrich (Demolitions), Sam Jeffreys (Engineer's voice), Luchian Deurell (Engineer's face), Guilherme Chirin\u00e9a (Medic), Erik Hogan (???)\n\nPlaytesters:\nChristian Miniscalco, Jacob Canull, Matt Griffith, Matthew Gatland\n------------------\nMy Xbox gamertag: Shad0wx54x\nMy PlayStation gamertag: ToughGamingGuyYT\n\nWanna see more of my fantastic walkthroughs?
