They then trick the ship by ramming their own vehicle into it. The impact, however, badly damages both and destroys all but one of the escape pods, as well as killing all but four from each ship (eight in total). The few survivors fight for the final escape pod and a chance of survival.", "summary": "What kind of un-be-leev-ably ugly monster is this? Chunks of armor fly off as you pound its body.
