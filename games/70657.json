This place bears a strong resemblance to Kyoto at the end of the Heian period, where the Minamoto clan (Genji), led by Minamoto no Yoritomo (based on the historical Minamoto no Yoritomo), is at war with the Taira clan (Heike), led by Taira no Kiyomori (based on the historical Taira no Kiyomori). The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the Earth's natural flow of energies and to terrorize the land. The boy that Nozomi met is revealed to be the human form of Hakury\u016b, the White Dragon God said to protect Ky\u014d, whose powers have greatly weakened due to the presence of the onry\u014d. Nozomi discovers that she has the power to seal the onry\u014d as Hakury\u016b no Miko, and she allies herself with the Genji in order to seal the onry\u014d, restore Hakury\u016b's powers, and return home to her own world.", "summary": "An otome dating sim.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harukanaru-toki-no-naka-de-3", "videos": [{"id": 75779, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xfzFBJ-PQF4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzFBJ-PQF4", "title": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3 - Battles", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfzFBJ-PQF4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
