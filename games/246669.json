This rain, combined with the new Tanabata amplifying the stars' power, prompts Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae to investigate.", "summary": "Touhou Project fangame developed by Maceknight and Raichu that originated as a Touhou styled music album, but was eventually made into a game. Gameplay revolves around collecting star items dropped from enemies, where more can be obtained by attacking enemies at close range. Collecting star items increases the Magnitude gauge, which leads to higher point multipliers. Star items do many other things: they factor in gaining resource pieces, they increase the point item value, and gathering enough in a stage will trigger the stage boss's \"Last word\" spell card.\n\nThis game uses the chapter system of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, and is also divided into two modes: \"Legendary Hero Mode\" with infinite lives, and the regular \"Legacy Mode\". Legendary Hero Mode is different from Pointdevice Mode in that it ignores what chapter you're on; instead, you simply respawn where you died, either at that exact spot or at the bottom of the screen (depending on the setting in the Option menu).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-mahoujou-book-of-star-mythology", "videos": [{"id": 88418, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PD2JcAN66rc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD2JcAN66rc", "title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u9b54\u5b9d\u57ce ~ Book of Star Mythology - Legacy Mode Lunatic 1cc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PD2JcAN66rc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
