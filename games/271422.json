Don't Scream is an Unreal Engine 5 short horror experience inspired by '90s camcorder found footage. Made by two indie devs. The challenge is simple: explore the mysterious Pineview Forest for 18 minutes without screaming.\n\nSounds easy, right? But there's a catch. Time only progresses as you move, and you cannot predict the scares. You must calibrate your microphone in-game so that every whimper, jump, or even a minor squeak is registered as a scream, increasing the challenge. With dozens of dynamic scares, each playthrough offers a unique experience.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dont-scream", "videos": [{"id": 105329, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-FCQezBOyrU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FCQezBOyrU", "title": "Don't Scream \u2013 Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FCQezBOyrU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
