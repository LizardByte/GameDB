The start map is followed by 2 a2base and a q3gothic map. It also features some new ambient sounds.\n\nI was one of the first map packs to be extensively large and demonstrated the full ability of the Quake \"id tech 1\" engine. This map pack is still largely popular to this day, and earned favorable reviews.\n\nThe map received a nod in the 2017 video game \"Quake Champions\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66440, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "t3xzMEUeF1E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xzMEUeF1E", "title": "Quake Insomnia M2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t3xzMEUeF1E/sddefault.jpg"}]}
