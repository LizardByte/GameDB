A free demo will be available on the Nintendo eShop from December 28 and pre-orders will receive a 25% discount until January 16, 2019.\n\nOctahedron is a psychedelic neon action platformer in which the player defies gravity by pulling platforms from thin air, while surfing through its levels to a driving beat. The game's soundtrack, a vibrant array of uplifting and atmospheric tunes, from chiptune trance over synthwave to progressive house, has been turning heads since its original release! It features music by Chipzel, Andr\u00e9 Sobota, Monomirror, and others. With subtly evolving rhythm elements, Octahedron encourages players to get into the flow of its hypnotizing beats.\n\nBuy Nintendo eShop Cards at Playasia: https://goo.gl/WKr5Ew\nBuy Nintendo Switch Games at Playasia:  https://goo.gl/xy9uwX\n\n** Use \"HPLAYERS\" coupon for a $3 USD off discount at Playasia **\n\nGet the latest Nintendo Switch News at Handheld Players: http://www.handheldplayers.com\n\nFollow Handheld Players:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HandheldPlayers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HandheldPlayers\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/1/+HandheldPlayers\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/handheldplayers", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QR63U0j6We8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QR63U0j6We8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QR63U0j6We8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QR63U0j6We8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QR63U0j6We8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Octahedron: Transfixed Edition - Nintendo Switch Announcement Trailer", "description": "Square Enix Collective today announced that Octahedron: Transfixed Edition will be released for Nintendo Switch on January 17, 2019 for $12.99 / \u20ac12.99 / \u00a39.99.
