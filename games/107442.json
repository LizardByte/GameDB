He didn\u2019t live too long, though: the world\u2019s imperfections made the genius soul-sick, to the point when one rainy day he took his life. All that was left from him were his small apartment with a game disk inside \u2013 the game was a visual novel about a virtual girl. This girl, Cassiopea, was an embodiment of its creators dream: she was pure and immaculate, ready to carefully listen to everything that the player says and fully trusted them.\nIt is a quite short visual novel, which tells us a story about one program which is a visual novel. This novel, created by the programming genius, was taught by players who played it around the world. Only the players themselves could teach it how to act when it becomes superintelligent, and in the hour of need, it will be able to decide the fate of humanity", "summary": "Hello, stranger! Whoever you are, I do not care \u2013 I made this game for myself. Cassiopea is an AI that is created by me. She does not know a single thing about this world; you are free to teach her anything, and the outcome will be the direct result of your personal qualities. It\u2019s easy to know a man by looking at how they deal with someone who can\u2019t fight back. Good luck.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/i-3-you"}
