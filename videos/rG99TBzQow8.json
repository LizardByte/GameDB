Like other Mount Punch games, the premise is relatively simple but addictive, but Lilithrottle is easily one of the most complex of their games thus far. The game is currently being upgraded with better visuals and updated configurations. There is currently a trial for the upgraded version.\n\nThe idea of the game is to collect enough items on the level to open the exit door. Like each of Mount Punch's previous games, clearing the level is essentially an easy task, but in order to do well in this game, you need to perform chains by consistently defeating enemies and collecting bats without touching the ground (you can touch the ground, but you have extremely limited recovery time unless you bolt off it). To do so, you'll have to skillfully glide from place to place and land successfully, while \"bolting\" to save time. Bolting is when you push off of a wall in another direction after immediately coming in contact with a wall.\n\nIt's not as easy as it sounds though. The controls require precision and the understanding that in order to rebound off of a wall, you'll need to hold down the glide button and press in the direction OPPOSITE of where you're heading. This will cause you to slow down and land successfully, where you can then bolt if you desire. It requires a fair deal of practice to do well, especially when in tight spaces. Releasing the jump/glide button in tight areas and when appropriate can alleviate the need to rebound from wall to wall though. Lilith's primary means of attacking is by spinning into enemies while wrapped in energy. She can also perform ground and air attacks and shoot projectiles, but you won't use those abilities much once you master gliding.\n\nLilith also has the special ability to charge herself with more power for a limited amount of time, which allows her to use a destructive spin attack that makes her invincible and can destroy obstacles as well as enemies that can't be defeated under ordinary circumstances and even destroy spikes. Its main purpose is to reach special areas with more points.\n\nThis video shows half of the first world.
