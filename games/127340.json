It introduces new elements such as bombs, magnets and walls, and uses the one-layer two-angles arcade rules. \n \nWork your way through 50 cleverly designed levels with increasing difficulty which will challenge both your mind and logic. You can play either in single or various multiplayer modes. \n \nAlso known as \"Rahjongg: The Curse of Ra\", it was first released commercially by eGames and as shareware by UsedStar; the shareware version contained the first sixteen levels of the game (available to download on the Curse of Ra website). An add-on mission pack, Ra's Revenge containing fifty extra levels was also released by both eGames and UsedStar. \n \nRa's Revenge and the other mission packs are also available on the Curse of Ra website."}
