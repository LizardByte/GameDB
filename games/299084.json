However, everything began to turn for the worse. Three enemies threatened Cincuenta's existence and the balance of his home.\n\nThe main enemy was \"Human Being,\" the human being. With his insatiable desire for expansion and development, \"Human Being\" drained the canals, built over them, and poured toxic substances that poisoned the water. But he did not act alone. He had two minions who were just as destructive.\n\n\"Junk,\" the garbage, was evidence of human being responsibility. It floated in the water, tangled among the plants, and choked aquatic life. Each 'Junk' was a reminder of \"Human Being's\" carelessness and how their actions directly affected beings like 'Cincuenta.'\n\nFinally, there was \"Carp the Fish,\" the carp fish. Artificially introduced into Cincuenta's habitat, this fish became a voracious predator. With its insatiable appetite, \"Carp the Fish\" consumed everything in its path, including the eggs and hatchlings of the axolotls.", "summary": "2D action/adventure platformer game with an Ecological theme.\n\n\"Saving the Axolotl\" is not just a game; it is an emotional adventure that immerses the player in \"Cincuenta\u2019s\" constant struggle to protect his home.
