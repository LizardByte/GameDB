This run strives to collect all 105 items, while beating the game as fast as possible. Just as a note, this TAS is NOT 100% optimized. There are still many improvements to be made, but considering it is my first ever TAS I think I did a pretty good job.\n\nThis run is full of clips and fast paced action. The route I used follows the current RTA route, with a small exception being when Ice Beam is collected.\n\nMajor shoutouts to EternisedDragon (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5M90zTdMDWQpxnCgcIuoRA) who helped me for a bunch of things in this TAS.
