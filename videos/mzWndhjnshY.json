{"id": "mzWndhjnshY", "snippet": {"title": "Dr. Mario 64 (N64) Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 2001 puzzle game for the Nintendo 64, Dr. Mario 64.\n\n1:44 How to Play\n5:18 Story Mode, Mario (Hard)\n1:03:22 Story Mode, Wario (Super Hard)\n1:51:08 Vs. Computer, Metal Mario vs. Octo\n1:55:24 Vs. Computer, Vampire Wario vs. Hammer-Bot\n1:58:45 Marathon Mode\n2:06:24 Score Attack Mode\n2:10:03 Classic Mode played through round 40. Special scenes are played during the credit sequence when you finish rounds 21, 24, 30, 35, and 40.\n\nDr. Mario 64 is an excellent update/remake of the original 1990 classic originally released for the NES and Game Boy, and was later updated for its SNES release in Tetris & Dr. Mario.\n\nThe core game play stays completely true to the original, but this package has a number of updates that really make it feel like a full-fledged sequel than a reskinned game that was already over ten years old in 2001. \n\nThe story mode is one of the biggest changes, and it does wonders for the single-player game. Sure, you can play the traditional mode found in every other game in the series, but story mode really gives the game a personable, goal-driven focus. You can play as Mario or Wario, each with their own individual story lines, cutscenes, and secret final bosses: if he doesn't lose a round on normal (or harder), Mario will fight Vampire Wario (who is seriously one of the creepiest, coolest characters ever produced in the Mario universe - why haven't we seen more of him?!), and Wario will fight Metal Mario (who has appeared since, despite not being anywhere near as cool as Vampire Wario). \n\nThe multiplayer game has seen a huge boost, too, thanks in large part to the 4-player mode. This fantastic addition was a natural fit for the N64's four built-in controller ports, and it gives Dr. Mario 64 a strong standing in the N64's heavy-hitting library of multiplayer party games. For those that don't care for the multiplayer, you can still get a taste of the 4P action in the story mode: there is a match where you have to take on several opponents at once.\n\nFinally, the presentation works extremely well on just about every level. The cutscenes all look like they were pulled straight out of Paper Mario, with characters appearing as drawings pasted onto cardboard pieces that bop and flit around the screen. The soundtrack is largely a remix of older tunes, and like most of Nintendo's older music, it holds up just fine, no matter what platform it appears on.\n\nI got Dr. Mario with my Game Boy for Christmas the year it came out and played it to death. This is the same game as I remember from my childhood, but the changes and updates make it feel both familiar and fresh at the same time. \n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzWndhjnshY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzWndhjnshY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mzWndhjnshY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Dr. Mario 64 (N64) Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 2001 puzzle game for the Nintendo 64, Dr. Mario 64.\n\n1:44 How to Play\n5:18 Story Mode, Mario (Hard)\n1:03:22 Story Mode, Wario (Super Hard)\n1:51:08 Vs.
