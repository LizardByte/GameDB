Only 24 copies of Venture II were produced. The first four carts were part of a pre-production run so Tim could get the manufacturing process fine tuned. Those first four are marked with Greek letters on the label. Tim then created 20 numbered copies of Venture II which he made available privately at the 2001 Classic Gaming Expo. One copy of Venture II sold at the CGE2K1 auction and went for over $200. Tim created perhaps the most extravagant packaging seen for a self-published title at the time--the game was delivered in a hand-crafted, miniature treasure chest, which opened to reveal the cartridge (with numbered label) and a manual, surrounded by elegant, gold leaf paper.\n\nIf you'd like to purchase a copy of Venture II (sans the fancy treasure chest packaging), you can do so in the AtariAge Store. Included is a beautifully illustrated twelve page manual by Dale Crum.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/venture-ii"}
