She doesn't seem to be getting many exciting cases. She's handed a folder containing an old case, one that put her two friends Blake Belladona and Weiss Schnee against each other.\n\n-----------\nRuby Rose Ace Attorney is a crossover between the Ace Attorney video game series and the RWBY webseries. RWBY characters have been adapted to fit into the world of Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney. Some characters may have been modified in the crossover. Players will play as Ruby Rose, a newbie defense attorney and defend her clients.\n\nFor those that don't know how to play Ace Attorney games, it's essentially like a visual novel. You keep progressing through dialogue until you reach a point where you must contradict witness testimony using evidence. You will point out something they are lying about. That's pretty much the formula for how you play.\n\nFor more Ruby Rose Ace Attorney GO HERE - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM9lVP5_rVu27Qj5eUKHeLh6e_iizvGSJ\n\nOr visit my deviantart for more updates -http://iceninjax77.deviantart.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOQRXhL8BCM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOQRXhL8BCM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOQRXhL8BCM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOQRXhL8BCM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOQRXhL8BCM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ruby Rose Ace Attorney - Case 2 ~ PLAYABLE", "description": "It's here!
