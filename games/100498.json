With a view from above, you control the victim machine on the map, which is pursued by hunters. Escape them and hide in the bushes, so it will be harder for them to find you. With each successful avoidance, you will get points. After 100 000 points is collected, you will win. The principle of playing multiplayer is the same, but the hunter becomes the one who created the lobby."}
