He carries around a long stick which he slyly uses to take down his enemies. He has a few more tricks up his sleeves - thanks to his magic book (press 'Run' and select a weapon by pressing 'up' and 'down'), he can also shoot blasts of energy from it. However, this technique depletes some of his magic energy which he has to refill periodically. But his ultimate weapon is the ability to turn into a powerful topless fighter - this technique is however only available for the toughest boss encounters located at the end of each area. In this form, our hero can use a powerful chain-whip (which consumes magic energy) to land more punishing blows than his bare fists. Throughout the game, various enemies drop magic orbs when defeated which range from power-ups (red P), increase max-life (green P), increase magic bar (green M), freeze time clocks, bombs, life potions and so forth. Each defeated enemy also drop money that can later be used to purchase life and magic from town people located at the end of each area. This is also where the stick can be later upgraded into a more lethal spear. Finally, infinite continues are available.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tatsunoko-fighter"}
