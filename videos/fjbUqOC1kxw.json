Dr. Jake Huntington enlisted in the army to forget the loss of his wife. Yet something sinister and ancient is about to overturn his life forever. Shadows that inhabit the confines of reality seem to converge all in one point: a terrifying disease that threatens to exterminate the entire human race.\n\nHowever, the disease is just one of the pieces that make up a vast mosaic, and discovering its design may not be that easy. Intrigues, machinations and subterfuges hide the truth, tearing it away from the doctor\u2019s understanding.\n\nTo connect all the dots, Jake will have to cross a threshold beyond which many before him have lost the way of reason.\n\nAre you willing to open this door?", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjbUqOC1kxw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjbUqOC1kxw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjbUqOC1kxw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjbUqOC1kxw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjbUqOC1kxw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Omen Exitio: Plague - Trailer", "description": "Available now on Steam: https://tinyurl.com/OmenExitio-SteamYT\n\nOmen Exitio: Plague is inspired by the gamebooks of the '80s and '90s, mixing the alien and horrifying universe created by H.P.
