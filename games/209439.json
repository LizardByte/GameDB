Title and characters are an homage to Fuxoft. Takes place in a Czechoslovak apartment building, with gameplay based on map navigation and puzzle-solving against a time limit, controlled by keyboard shortcuts rather than typed-in commands.\n\nReceived an English translation in 2021 as part of an initiative by the Slovak Game Developers Association in cooperation with Slovak Design Museum, with funding by the Slovak Arts Council.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fuksoft"}
