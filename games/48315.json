The game is based on the high school and baseball team themed manga Touch. City Adventure Touch is somewhat notorious in Japan for bearing absolutely no resemblance to the source material. A comic book concerning the Mystery of Triangle is included in the manual. The story appears to revolve around a character's dog who disappears into an alternate dimension, and the three children who attempt to rescue it, one of which attacks by throwing baseballs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-adventure-touch-mystery-of-triangle"}
