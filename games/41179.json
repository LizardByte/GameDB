Thousands of lives were lost in the initial attack, and hundreds more in the chaotic aftermath. The remaining human colonists rallied and began to strategize a retaliation, but it was too late. The Draxx had called back their forces to the far side of the planet's only moon - taking with them the control orbs from the now rapidly cooling thermal-boosters, halting the terraforming process and reverting the planet back to an inhabitable and desolate ice world. \n \nYOU are mankind's only hope. Infiltrate the Draxx Moonspire, cause as much devastation as possible and reclaim the stolen orbs! \n \nMoonspire is a sprawling flip-screen exploratory sci-fi shmup developed for the 1983 Commodore 64 home computer by Du\u0161an Milivojevi\u0107. Initially created as a short one-level demo back in 2014, this final six-level commercial release of the game features over 260 screens to fight through, enhanced firing mechanics and audio by Ari \"agemixer\" Yliaho.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moonspire"}
