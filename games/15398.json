You control Pax as he is pursued by the besotted Truffle Princess, combining classic platforming action with imaginative puzzle-solving as you must move, stack, and use objects to create new paths to jump and clamber on, all while the Truffle Princess draws ever closer.\n\nBeing in a dream, even if it is a nightmare, can have its advantages. Pax can transform into different forms to help him negotiate the world, each with its own distinct and powerful abilities. You can use the forms to scamper across vertical walls, turn invisible, or even fly across vast chasms, but using them at the right time is the key.\n\nMushroom Men: Truffle Trouble hooks you with its distinct gameplay, then keeps you engaged with its beautiful worlds, quirky humor, and Pax\u2019s super-powered forms.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mushroom-men-truffle-trouble"}
