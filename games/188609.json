To make suggestions, other players must write their response in the chat. If the answer is wrong, other players can see the guess that was made. On the other hand, if there is only one character difference between the proposed answer and the expected one, then only the player who made the proposal is informed that he is very close to the correct answer.\n\nIn each round, it is possible to earn a maximum of 100 points:\nFor those who must guess the word, their score depends on the time elapsed since the start of the round (70%) and the percentage of players who answered correctly before them (30%).\nFor the drawer, his score depends on the time of the first player to find (30%), as well as the percentage of players who find the correct answer (70%).\nOnce the points have been awarded, a new drawer is randomly selected by the game.\n\nThe game ends when the number of rounds or the overall time has elapsed.
