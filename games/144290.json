While fighting against other users of SpellForce 3: Versus, you can also face players from the expansions Fallen God and Soul Harvest - there will be just one big SpellForce 3 player base.\n\nSpellForce 3: Versus will have NO microtransactions, NO advertisement or any other common Free-to-play mechanic. You can play Versus absolutely free of charge, only if you want to have access to the singleplayer campaigns from SpellForce 3, SpellForce 3: Soul Harvest or SpellForce 3: Fallen God, you'll have to buy them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a Multiplayer-Upgrade pack available, allowing you to choose from each of the six different SpellForce-factions: Humans, Orcs, Dwarves, Dark Elves, Trolls and Elves.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spellforce-3-versus", "videos": [{"id": 46284, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "f0ZiQV4XqMI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0ZiQV4XqMI", "title": "SpellForce 3: Versus - Free Multiplayer Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f0ZiQV4XqMI/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 961, "name": "Spellforce"}]}
