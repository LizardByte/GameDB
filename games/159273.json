The player controls a hand, which they must position on a dart board to score points. There are 10 levels of difficulty, which determine the shakiness of the throwing arm. The player also sets the level of the computer opponent. The player counts down points from 1001, 905, 501, or 301. The first player to reach a score of 0 is the winner, and the scoring points must be a double. The player can choose to require a double at the start of the game."}
