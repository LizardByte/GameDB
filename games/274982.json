You\u2019re probably here because you\u2019re looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros, right? If so, Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you. Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty. Most hacks that redo levels (at least the ones that I\u2019ve tried) make the game nearly impossible! I\u2019ve had quite a few games where I couldn\u2019t get past the first few levels without savestates. In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don\u2019t think you can.\n\nThat is why SMBHF\u2019s levels are about as difficult as the original game\u2019s. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer\u2019s enjoyment, not for the gamer\u2019s frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.\n\nThe lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include: New floor tile, New underwater tile, New \u201c?\u201d blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others. There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game. (And yes, those lines on Mario\u2019s face are longer sideburns.)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-bros-hf"}
