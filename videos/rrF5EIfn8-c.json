{"id": "rrF5EIfn8-c", "snippet": {"title": "GeoRunner - Ohio Distincive Software (1998) Longplay", "description": "GeoRunner is an educational geography game published by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1998. You play as Blit, a radical skateboarding robot that keeps getting arrested by the cops for some reason. It's your job to find the keys keeping him locked up and to set him free. The keys are scattered all over the world, and as the difficulty increases, the clues become more challenging and the map labels are removed. You are also upgraded to a pretty sweet jet.\nOnce Blit is freed however, he always ends up crashing his skateboard and gets arrested yet again.\n\nThis longplay includes completing every difficulty of the game and visits to every level. At the end I tried showing off some smaller things about the game (showing that the world map doesn't loop around, and that when you lose all of your fuel and crash, you lose all of your keys).\n\nI wanted to upload this because this game was a big part of my childhood and I couldn't find any footage of it on Youtube. Fortunately this game along with many other Ohio Distinctive games has been preserved digitally and can be found archived online. \n\nOhio Distinctive still operates but seems to be out of software publishing. Their facebook page suggests that they shut down during covid and reopened selling items such as mugs.\n\nIf you played this game please comment and let me know the when and where. My mother worked for the marketing firm that Ohio Distinctive used, so we ended up with discs of many of their games. I'm guessing that if anyone else played these games it would have been in a school setting but I'm not sure.\n\n\nThis session was recorded on December 8th, 2022 using DOSBox running Windows 3.1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrF5EIfn8-c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrF5EIfn8-c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrF5EIfn8-c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "GeoRunner - Ohio Distincive Software (1998) Longplay", "description": "GeoRunner is an educational geography game published by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1998.
