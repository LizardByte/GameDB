It was released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) in 2008 and later for the PlayStation 2. The game is a spin-off from the popular Ratchet & Clank series and features Clank as the main character in a secret agent role.\n\nIn the game, Clank dons his \"Secret Agent Clank\" persona, which was previously seen in brief TV show segments within the main series. The story revolves around Clank working to clear Ratchet's name after Ratchet is framed for a crime he did not commit. The gameplay diverges from the traditional Ratchet & Clank format, focusing more on stealth and gadget-based play, though it retains the series' trademark humour and style.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/secret-agent-clank", "videos": [{"id": 104749, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0KVjwM-Srd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KVjwM-Srd8", "title": "Secret Agent Clank Sony PSP Trailer - Official", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0KVjwM-Srd8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
