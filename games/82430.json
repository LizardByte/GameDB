Will your prison disregard human rights, impose intentional harshness and be devoid of any notions of wellbeing and freedom? The choice is yours. \n\nIn Prison Architect you will see the impact of your grand design on the lives of your inmates; be it a utopic center for rehabilitation, a brutal Super Max Prison or anything in between. Even when all of your prisoners\u2019 needs are met, remember one thing - it\u2019s still a prison and no one really wants to be there.\n\nStart your journey into the world of Prison Architect by playing through the Prison Stories (campaign). Here you\u2019ll learn the ropes by being brought in to equip a small prison with everything it needs to perform its first execution, all before being called up to deal with emergencies at larger and larger prisons. You\u2019ll quickly learn how to cope with blazing infernos, hostage situations and prison wide riots - if you make it through all that unscathed, the Mayor will be ready to give you the reigns of a brand new prison development where you can build the prison of your dreams.\n\nBuild and Manage A Maximum Security Prison\n\nOnce you are ready to begin building your own prison, in Architect Mode (sandbox) you can either choose to take control of one of several pre-built prisons right away or build one entirely from scratch.\n\nActing as both architect and governor, you control every detail of your Prison - from building new cells and facilities to hiring staff and creating reform programs - all while dealing with informants, contraband smuggling, gang warfare, full scale riots and more!\n\nOnce your prison is built, go online with World of Wardens to share your designs with the community. You can also browse and play other Architects\u2019 prisons from around the world!"}
