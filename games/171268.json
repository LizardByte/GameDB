Set in a singles bar, the object of the game is to \u201cscore\u201d with as many members of the opposite sex as possible. When the onscreen Lothario makes contact with the object of his (or her) affections, a heart appears on screen. A cocktail version of the game came in a heart-shaped cabinet."}
