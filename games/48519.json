He must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is his turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that he will play as for the game(s). The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode, of course. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes (3:00) apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).", "videos": [{"id": 22985, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "Ci1CKiLKY7c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci1CKiLKY7c", "title": "Datach - J League Super Top Players (J)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ci1CKiLKY7c/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
