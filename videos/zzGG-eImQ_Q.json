We'll get an exclusive look into their ambitious new DLC sized mod: Fallout London. This project boldly envisions a new worldspace with new faction, threats, rich writing and celebrity guest voice actors.\nTime(s): 25/06/2022 - 5PM EDT / 2PM PDT / 10PM BST\n______________\n\nFallout: London is a DLC-sized mod for Bethesda\u2019s Fallout 4. As a continuation of the base game, the mod will allow the player to visit the previously unexplored post-apocalyptic environment of London.\n\nAs a divergence from previous official titles in the series, Fallout: London is not set in America. Visiting a totally new setting allows for us to explore totally new cultures which have not homogenized with their American counterparts. It also allows us to explore pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain.\n\nTeam FOLON\u00ae operates as an independent entity responsible for the development of the Fallout: London mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4\u2122 game. We want to emphasize that Team FOLON\u00ae is a separate legal entity from Bethesda\u2122, the publisher of Fallout 4\u2122.\n\n- \ud835\udde9\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7\ud835\udde6 -\nVideo and Logo by SunnyDelight\nhttps://www.artstation.com/c3delight\n\nAudio Master and Music by Daniel Morrison Neil\nhttps://soundcloud.com/danielismakingmsomemusic\n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfc:\nOfficial Announcement Trailer Extended Mastercut -\nhttps://youtu.be/BngA-Xoa9XI\n\n - \ud835\udddd\ud835\udde2\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0 -\nWant to join our team?
