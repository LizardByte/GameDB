Each ship can fire an energy beam towards the other one, creating a barrier able to damage enemies. This innovative approach to combat completely rewrites the rules of the shooter genre! \n \nThe strong 90\u2019s anime vibe of the game has been further stressed by a visual style aimed at honoring the classic arcades of that period, with vibrant colors and flashy design. \n \nIt\u2019s time for the vertical scrolling shooter genre to be back in style!", "videos": [{"id": 12197, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "7KxVNwGZ8QA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KxVNwGZ8QA", "title": "Gemini_X teaser trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7KxVNwGZ8QA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
