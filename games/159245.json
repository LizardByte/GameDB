Why accept those bastardised imitations anymore? So please share with your family and friends and put Shout Seven back onto the high and mighty pedestal it once ruled proudly from. You can even send your impudent rivals into the very flaming pits of Hell!", "summary": "Set in Ye Olde England, with stunning visuals and simple gameplay, this is an all new, addictive, medieval romp that takes alignment challenges to the next level, with a brand new way to move.\n\n-You can start anywhere on the board\n-You can only go where your opponents let you\n-You can push your opponents off the board\n\nFor two, three, and even four players, Shout Seven is a whole new take on the classic struggle of wits. You are rewarded for your cunning but punished for the slightest mistake. You can advance from Knight to Monarch or be demoted to Peasant. Even without a single stone in play, you still have the chance to declare victory over your defeated foes.\n\nSo read of the discovery of this fabled royal game in the hallowed grounds of Avalon and let us put it back on its noble pedestal!\n\nYes, there are ads, but the chancellor has a war to fund against the barbarian hordes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shout-seven"}
