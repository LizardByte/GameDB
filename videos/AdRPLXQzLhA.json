I piloti si allenano incessantemente e rischiano la vita per questa sfida estrema.\n\nTHE SIREN\n\nShe waits.\nThe Siren of the Irish Sea.\nFor the brave. For the fearless. For the bold. Seeking out their destiny.\nIn the heart of every rider. Her rhythm beats like a drum. The pulse of everything you trained for, of everything you have sacrificed and become.\nIn the heart of every fan. She draws you in, pounding at your soul, injecting life through your veins. A desire born to your blood. You have one focus, one passion, one goal.\nAnd you are finally with her; the wait comes to an end. A legacy before you. And the air is electric, and the silence echoes with anticipation. You are not alone here. A band of brothers, of sisters, of warriors and friends.\nBecause this is living and this is life, she is everything you expected. And the call of the road is upon you. Desire in your spirit. Thunder and lightning between your bones and your soul.\nThis is the moment you've been waiting for.\nThis is your moment.\nThis\u2026 is the Isle of Man TT.\n\n- Nancy Von Short\n\n-------------------------------\n\nPer maggiori informazioni \u25ba https://www.iomtt-thegame.com/ \n\nSeguici su Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/bigbengamesit/\n\nSeguici su Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/TTIoMtheGame\n\nSeguici su Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/TTIoMtheGame\n\nIscriviti per vedere pi\u00f9 video  \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGrFnkxBlgZnrOn5Cn52QQ", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdRPLXQzLhA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdRPLXQzLhA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdRPLXQzLhA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdRPLXQzLhA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdRPLXQzLhA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TT Isle of Man - The Siren", "description": "Vieni con noi sull'Isola di Man e scopri la passione che circonda la mitica gara di TT.
