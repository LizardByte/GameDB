The spies fought by means of throwing snowballs at each other and setting traps, which decreased their body heat bar. Tools the spies used included a saw which allowed a hole to be cut in the ice for the second player to fall into and lose body heat. Lost body heat could be restored by moving into an igloo with a heater inside.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spy-vs-spy-3"}
