They are as follows: Ford Bold Moves Street Racing in the US and Canada, Ford Street Racing: L.A. Duel in the EU, and Ford Street Racing: XR Edition in Australia and New Zealand. It was released September 19, 2006 in the United States. It was developed by Razorworks and published by Empire Interactive under the Empire banner in the US and under the Xplosiv banner in the rest of the world. The game received mostly mixed to negative reviews.\n\nThe console and PC versions of the game have 18 cars, while the Australian XR Edition swapped 3 standard cars for 3 iconic Australian market Falcons.\n\nThe PSP versions were sold with the same regional title tweaks that the console versions received, but \"in a substantially expanded form, with more cars, tracks, and team modes than even the home versions had to offer\".[3] Compared to the console versions, the US market Bold Moves and EU market L.A. Duel added six extra cars (bringing the total to 24) and six new tracks (making a total of 18). The Australian XR Edition added two Falcon sedans (a 1970 Falcon GT-HO and a 2005 Falcon GT-XR8) and a 2005 Falcon XR8 ute to the garage, making for a total of 27 vehicles. All other aspects of the three games are the same.\n\nThe gameplay on the Sony PSP versions is similar to the console versions in that the player has to win various solo and team championships to unlock new tracks, new vehicles and unlock new tournaments to earn cash to purchase those newly unlocked vehicles and/or repair the ones they currently own. These unlocked cars, tracks, and race types can be raced, without consequence, in the Arcade mode. One difference from the console versions is that the damage is cosmetic only and the performance of the vehicle is not affected by crash damage.\n\nFord Street Racing (C) Strategy First\nDeveloped by Razorworks\nPublished by Empire Interactive | Xplosiv\nAlso available on PC, Xbox and PSP\n\n#ford #fordracing #fordstreetracing #strategyfirst #retrogames #retrogaming #playstation2 #ps2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKhFIQAKdAM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKhFIQAKdAM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKhFIQAKdAM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKhFIQAKdAM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKhFIQAKdAM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ford Street Racing  - PlayStation 2 Gameplay", "description": "Known in the US as \"Ford Bold Moves Street Racing\"\n\nThe game was sold as Ford Street Racing on the PC while the various console releases were given region specific names.
