It combined RPG gameplay with real-time combat, combined fantasy with sci-fi elements, and introduced survival mechanics.\n\nThe game was designed by Yoshio Kiya, this was possibly the first action RPG. These innovative ideas about RPG design departed significantly from the turn-based norm at the time. It introduced real-time combat, sci-fi elements, a persistent open world with day-night cycle, and survival mechanics. This was a precursor to Falcom's seminal action RPG franchise, Dragon Slayer. In 1984, he would go on to create Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer franchise, which laid the foundations for the real-time, action RPG genre.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/panorama-toh"}
