The Brotherhood of Nod has lost its leader, Kane, and the Inner Circle is fracturing the organization. Its remnants, under the command of Anton Slavik, are on the hunt for the Tacitus, which is currently under research by GDI. The Kodiak was on its course to deliver the Tacitus to the Southern Cross base, but is shot down by an ion storm. Both factions search for the Tacitus in the Kodiak wreckage, but GDI seems to be faster.\n\nWhile Nod was busy throwing GDI forces into disarray with the help of the reactivated CABAL, GDI was attempting to restore order in several sectors, defending the civilians from Tiberian beasts (like the newly discovered Tiberium Floater). GDI was caught off-guard when Tratos was assassinated, and that event stroke a terrible blow to the Tacitus research process, as he was the only one who could decipher it. Time is running short, as Dr. Boudreau predicts that the Earth's atmosphere will be 100% toxic to humans in less than a year. To speed up the Tacitus research, and with it the process of Earth's recovery, GDI decides to capture CABAL.", "summary": "Utilizing the classic W3D Sage engine that powers the iconic Command & Conquer: Renegade, Tiberian Sun: Reborn is a standalone full-conversion platform that offers first-person shooter action in the Tiberian Sun universe.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiberian-sun-reborn", "videos": [{"id": 133206, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gVvhjuR_Elg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVvhjuR_Elg", "title": "Command & Conquer Reborn Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gVvhjuR_Elg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133207, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Qio4sozNl2k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qio4sozNl2k", "title": "Tiberian Sun Reborn Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qio4sozNl2k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
