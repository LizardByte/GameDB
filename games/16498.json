The world lies ravaged by war. Align yourself with one of six warring factions and fight for global domination in a world where borders rapidly shift as battles are won and lost.\n\nThis is March of War. An online turn-based strategy game set in a dieselpunk world where strategy and firepower rule the day. Take command and lead your army into 3D battlefields that allow you to assess the war-zone from every angle. Deploy a wide range of vehicles, infantry and artillery where their specific weapons can be most effective.\n\nDestroy your enemies and capture their territory to advance through the ranks of your faction. Rise high enough and you\u2019ll have the honour of joining your faction\u2019s High Command, or perhaps even be voted Faction Leader. Achieving High Command or Faction Leader status expands the game into an intricate web of political allegiances and betrayals, where your decisions directly influence the course of the war as you strive to lead your faction to global domination.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/march-of-war"}
