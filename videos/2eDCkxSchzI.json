Level ups! Random Dungeons! Traps! Badass bosses! Carrots! Ziggurat is the best combination of FPS Shooter and Rogue-LITE you have ever seen.\n\nBecome a neophyte sorcerer, and get ready for your rite of passage: Enter the labyrinth and face dangerous challenges to prove your worth and become a powerful wizard! \n\nThe game features a dark fantasy setting, inspired in the classic games Heretic/Hexen, with original gameplay mechanics and unlockable weapons/perks that enhance replayability.\n\nFight allmighty bosses, get through rooms filled with traps, and treasures that may help you in your journey... Each game is a whole new experience! \n\nUnlike most Rogue-thingies, on Ziggurat your combat skills will be the most important asset to keep advancing. Leveling up and random generated content is there to increase variety and make each game different, not to make the game a roll dice or an unbearable grind.\n\nMost perks are designed to change the way you have to play or the weapons you'll want to use. Do you want more speed in exchange for less health, or maybe is better to have mana regeneration? Increase drop rate, or refill ammo here and now? No number game here, simple and direct choices.\n\nWe've also ensured that, as a proper FPS game, the experience is quick and direct. There's no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.\n\nA whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!\n\nMagic staves, spellbooks, magic wands... dozens of weapons with different attack strategies that help keeping the game fresh!\n\nTrailer music by Gr\u00e9goire Lourme", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eDCkxSchzI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eDCkxSchzI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eDCkxSchzI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eDCkxSchzI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eDCkxSchzI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ziggurat - Launch Trailer", "description": "Dungeon-Crawling First Person Shooting at its finest!
