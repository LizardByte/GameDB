Strike! Knock Down! The target of the game is knocking down the cans with as less throws as possible. This may sound easy, and it is early levels, but you'll have to cope with moving objects in higher levels making the game increasingly difficult. The game stores your progression in persistant storage alllowing you to suspend a play and take it over whenever your want."}
