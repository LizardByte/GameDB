Similar to Mock 2: The Speed of Stupid, the WAD relies on ridiculous enemy placement, gratuitous abuse of ZDoom features, and intentionally terrible map design. The WAD was uploaded on /idgames archive on October 25, 2013. At the Cacowards 2013 it was highlighted in a \"Sing the Praises of Pants\" sidebar. The sequel, Wooo 2, was released a year later.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wooo"}
