In it, you can either design and build your own squad of soldiers or choose from pre-built characters. The two teams are the Gorgonites or Commando Elite. You choose specific parts you want your soldiers to have, such as arms and legs. You can also choose what kind of computer chip controls the soldier, what kind of voice they have and what weapons he will carry. After you create your soldiers, you then battle the opposite team.
