The only minigames I absolutely hated doing was the eel/sea urchin clicking game and the seahorse sac popping game, the former cause it's complete chance if all the sea urchins pop up within the time limit(in one attempt the eels weren't holding anything at all in their mouths), and the latter cause it's so hard to aim with the jellyfish.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XyMoNa3URT4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XyMoNa3URT4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XyMoNa3URT4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Rainbow Fish and the Whale PC Game - Complete Walkthrough - Both Endings", "description": "A bunch of fish get vored by a whale and go through trials such as popping the sac of a seahorse fetus and prying a walrus' tusks out of the whale's insides in order to return to the sea.\n\nTimeline\n3:25 - Find Giggles\n8:20 - Ward off Longlegs\n12:29 - Free Mallow\n15:21 - Muscles and Bubbles\n22:04 - Vocal Coral\n\nFirst Ending - Mouth Route\n27:42 - Pop the Seahorse Fetus Sac\n32:09 - Cure the Whale's Hiccups(Both Endings)\n37:00 - Travel to the Whale's Mouth\nTip: For this ending, you need to click on Sad(the transparent organism), but afterwards DO NOT click on Marcello(green lobster guy) because I'm pretty sure that'll override her and you'll end up with the geyser route.\n\nSecond Ending - Geyser Route\n42:06 - Fix the Sea Urchin Press\nTip: Again, ignore Sad and do not trigger the seahorse sac popping game.
