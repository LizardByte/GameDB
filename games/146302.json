When Ichitaro ends up living at the shrine for a while, he starts helping his childhood friend out on the job, and eventually, he realizes something.\n\nWhile Yachiyo is a diligent, hard-working priestess, she doesn't actually seem to believe in the shrine's deities, or the effect of their charms, at all. She also doesn't smile as much as she used to, almost as if she's given up on all hope in life. Without any friends at school, she always appears to be rather lonely.\n\nThen, one night...\n\nIchitaro wakes up sensing a strange presence, and finds Yachiyo perched on top of him, peering into his face. She looks almost like an entirely different person", "summary": "Loca-Love is a visual novel with art by nanaca mai, of Corona Blossom and Grisaia fame, and a story by Japanese writer Hozumi Kei, famous for his sweet and romantic love stories.\nThis is a three-part series, being Loca-Love: My Pure Priestess the third game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 48510, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "qx7m48FcNZc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx7m48FcNZc", "title": "Loca Love My Pure Priestess OP  Vocals Duca", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qx7m48FcNZc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
