With an ever-growing demand for electricity, you must strategically plan and construct an efficient and robust power grid to meet the needs of community residents and businesses.\n\nPower management is not just about keeping the lights on; it's about delivering a smooth and stable electricity supply. In Power Network Tycoon, you'll need to monitor and optimize various aspects of power quality, such as power factor and balancing loads between phases. Addressing these factors will improve the reliability of your network and keep your customers satisfied.\n\nAs you navigate the intricate world of power system analysis and industry engineering standards, you'll experience the most realistic power network simulation on the market. The game employs advanced physics-based calculations found in industrial electrical design software and challenges you to make decisions that reflect industry best practices.\n\nMother Nature can throw unexpected challenges your way, but as a resilient Power Network Tycoon, you're always prepared. Devastating storms, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events will put your skills to the test. Reinforce your infrastructure, strengthen power lines, use the weather forecasting systems to mitigate the impact of these natural disasters. Balancing resilience and cost-effectiveness becomes crucial as you strive to keep the lights on during even the harshest conditions.\n\nAs the island community flourishes, your expertise as a Power Network Tycoon will be put to the test. You'll have the opportunity to upgrade and expand your network by building new power generators, power lines, substations and capacitor banks.\n\nEnsuring the safety of the community is paramount. As the Power Network Tycoon, you'll be responsible for preventing electrical accidents and protecting your island's residents. Assess earth potential rise under fault conditions, measure electromagnetic field strengths, and upgrade equipment to minimize the risk of electrical overloading. Failure to prioritize safety could lead to unhappy customers, outages, and even death!\n\nWith its immersive gameplay and realistic simulations, Power Network Tycoon allows you to harness your engineering skills, showcase your strategic thinking, and prove yourself as the ultimate Power Network Tycoon, shaping the electricity landscape of a vibrant new island community.", "summary": "With its immersive gameplay and realistic simulations, Power Network Tycoon allows you to harness your engineering skills, showcase your strategic thinking, and prove yourself as the ultimate Power Network Tycoon, shaping the electricity landscape of a vibrant new island community.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/power-network-tycoon", "videos": [{"id": 107420, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gA1sHoiA1cs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA1sHoiA1cs", "title": "Power Network Tycoon - Out Now in Early Access!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gA1sHoiA1cs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
