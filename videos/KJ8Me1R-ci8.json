It's not just about horror but also about people, experiences, life and hardship intertwined with the origin story of my Dark Space Universe.\n\nI got inspired by Firewatch. Telling a story of a believable character. In my case named Michael, who isn't a superhero, just a normal guy, trying to find his friend Sara. But encounters a whole new world of challenges thrown at him.\n\nHe finds himself deeper and deeper drawn into the abyss of an area called Crystal Woods which is plagued by strange phenomenons for over 800 years.\nAnother inspiration were abandoned and lost places, so I introduced some extent of exploration or atleast the feeling induced through the voice over that Michael is giving his idea of what is going on, basically taking you with him experiencing what he perceives.\n\nThis is a Solo-Project and was quite a challenge to make. But I think it turned out as a quite special Horror Story.\n\nI hope you give it a shot and enjoy the journey of Michael.\n\nSee you in Crystal Woods.\nLeon Drace", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ8Me1R-ci8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ8Me1R-ci8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ8Me1R-ci8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Awakened: Dark Space | Release Trailer", "description": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1469490/Awakened_Dark_Space\nhttps://twitter.com/moonloregames\n\nShort Description:\nGo on a search to find your friend Sara who went missing in a mysterious area called Crystal Woods which is rumored to be cursed for over 800 years, since a certain incident.\n\nAdditional Info About The Game:\nIt has been quite a journey of changes, mistakes and struggles but last but not least not giving up and constantly improving.\nAll of this resulted in a game which is quite different to most horror games.
