The main character will spend 5 days as the caretaker of this island.\n\nOn this island surrounded by nature, please deepen exchanges with the residents, enjoy leisure, and find your own way to spend your time!\n\nThe story changes with the choice of men and women!\nThe game starts when the main character saw the article of \"Recruitment of Administrators\" on the Internet. In this work, you can choose the gender of the main character, and various changes may come depending on various events such as love.\n\nOn the island, the daily action time is fixed from 10 o'clock to 18 o'clock, and the time passes depending on the area movement and mini-games. Depending on the situation when you finish the 5-day experience, you will have a different ending.\n\nEvery time I play, I discover new things! There are 7 types of mini-games that appear during play, such as \"Eisa\", \"Palm Fruit\" and \"Snorkeling\"! Depending on the change in time and ganju (physical strength), the mini-games you can play may change.\n\nThe \"achievement rate\" will increase due to the progress of mini-games and the collection of illustrated book items. There are also special stories that occur when you master the achievement rate, so please take a walk all over the island!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chura-umi-monogatari"}
