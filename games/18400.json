When you pull the PlayStation VR headset on we place you in an arena that will test both your physical dexterity and mental skills. Working your way through a gauntlet of tests - from simply building a tower, to creating bridges, working out fiendish puzzles and blowing up enormous towers of blocks - Tumble VR will push your skills and brainpower to the limit.\n\nAlongside the new levels and visuals for Tumble VR, we have also added a new competitive mode. This uses the PlayStation VR Social Screen feature that allows a second player to play on the same TV together with the VR player to create a social VR experience.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tumble-vr", "videos": [{"id": 10451, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "T460pq02xs0"}, {"id": 10452, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zZ18ankzs-8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ18ankzs-8", "title": "Tumble VR | Launch Trailer | PlayStation VR", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ18ankzs-8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
