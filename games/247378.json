The game is based upon a notorious arcade shooter by Exidy. It was also released in Australia by Home Entertainment Suppliers.\n\nThe game is cited as one of the most violent games ever made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, let alone the 1980s video game medium. Despite being an unlicensed port, the game followed several official examples by being censored with some nudity covered up.\n\nIn the game, you are in various medieval settings, usually featuring innocent people restrained in torture devices. The gruesome motive is to kill every NPC in as little time as possible.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chiller--3"}
