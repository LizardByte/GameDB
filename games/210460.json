You'll be able to control your Sims over their entire lifetimes, taking them from their first steps to their golden years. Guide them through \"Life's Big Moments\" and build their \"Life Score\" with every decision you make. And since every Sim will have its own DNA, their appearance and personality will be passed down through the generations. Life in The Sims 2 will take on a whole different dimension with an entirely new 3-D engine."}
