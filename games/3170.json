Take on the role of a young farmer on an island and experience everyday life in the countryside. Choose from many vehicles and equipment and explore the island which is over 4 km square in size and freely accessible.\nPlay the improved career mode, beginning with a sparsely equipped farm and some old outdated vehicles. Your goal is to whip the farm into shape, extending the vehicle fleet and becoming a successful farmer. Through various activities such as plowing fields, seeding, pressing bales and the final harvest, you build up the financial resources necessary to allow you to buy better equipment. Visit the local agricultural machinery store to buy new vehicles and equipment or sell your old machines. You can choose from 7 very elaborate tractors, 4 combine harvesters and over 20 machines including ploughs, seeders, balers and a self-loading wagon. Thanks to the co-operation with the AGCO corporation, owner of the famous Fendt brand, you take control of very sophisticated tractors and combine harvesters. Due to the additional collaboration with Poettinger there are also many of their authentic tools available. And if this variety of machinery still does not meet your needs, you can download plenty of vehicles, equipment and other modifications from the Internet. Because of the improved mod system you are able to install the new content easily and automatically.\nThe new Farming Simulator also contains many different missions and tutorials as well as a realistic day and night cycle with changing weather conditions. Furthermore you can activate computer-controlled vehicles which help you to get your work done faster!", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farming-simulator-gold-edition"}
