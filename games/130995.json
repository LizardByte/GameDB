The rules are pretty similar to the original, but the places in the board are the most noticeable difference. Instead of pieces of land with street names, the board features country names, such as Spain, Turkey or Switzerland. After buying such places, players can build houses or hotels.\n\nUp to four players can take turns in this game. Each one starts with 7.500 dollars, and leaves the board when there's no money left to pay the bills. The last player standing wins.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/millionaire"}
