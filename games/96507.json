The graphics are basic but clear. The major difference is the game-play of course, which is very simple. Each player controls a squad of randomly assigned troops, you have limited action points and move/fire options. Whoever kills the other squad wins, no research, no campaign type options, just single map games. The players can select the side of the conflict (X-COM troops or Alien forces) and one of five available mission environments.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-com-em-at-il-games"}
