This is a longplay of game Robocop: The Future of Law Enforcement, from NES. This game was developed by Data East, but the NES version was published by Ocean Software. These game are a run & gun and beat 'em up hybrid released in 80s from multiple plataforms (Arcade, NES, ZX Spectrum, Amiga and others). Robocop is undoubtedly a very good movie, who does not remember the actors' first line of the season, as Kutwood Smith (Clarence Boddicker), Peter Weller (Officer Alex Murphy/RoboCop), Nancy Allen (Officer Lewis). Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy, a cop who worked the streets of Detroit. Since officially dead, Alex is transformed by OCP, a powerful multinational installed in Detroit, in a modern and powerful cyborg crime-fighting, called Robocop, endowed with the latest technology and firepower. Robocop takes on the role of defender of law and order on the streets of decaying Detroit, which is decayed by crime and corruption. But Robocop ends up being tormented by memories of Alex Murphy, his true identity. From there begins a relentless hunt for his attackers. Revenge becomes his prime directive. It's a simple game compared to the large version of the Arcade, but fulfilled his role well (even with a certain amateurism in design and few variety of musics).\n\nStage 1: 01:40\nStage 2: 03:48\nTraining Stage I: 07:56\nStage 3: 08:53\nStage 4: 13:21\nTraining Stage II: 17:17 \nStage 5: 18:08\nFinal Stage: 21:36 -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jt2hg1hlRb4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jt2hg1hlRb4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jt2hg1hlRb4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "NES Longplay [401] RoboCop", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nServe the public trust\nProtect the innocent\nUphold the law\n\nRobocop: Part Man, Part Machine, All game.
