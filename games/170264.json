The Ayashiro family owns a huge plot of land passed down from generation to generation, but there is a strange saying in the village that the dead will return to life to kill anyone who attempts to steal the treasure of the Ayashiro family. As the protagonist investigates the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, he discovers the terrifying connection between this saying and the serial killings which take place.", "summary": "Famicom Mini: Famicom Tantei Club - Kieta Koukeisha is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2004 by Nintendo. It is a remake of the Famicom title Famicom Tantei Club, and little to no alterations were made on the game to stay faithful to the original title. The game was not released in America or Europe, and thus was exclusive to Japan. It was part of the Famicom Mini Series that re-released a variety of classic Famicom games for the Game Boy Advance, similar to how they re-released classic NES games in North America.\n\nThis port has both parts (Zenpen and Kouhen) of Kieta Koukeisha, thus the player wouldn't need to change disks like in the original Famicom Disk System release.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
