The eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a jump attack with their weapons.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_0kKGOQOYxg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_0kKGOQOYxg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_0kKGOQOYxg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade gameplay", "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is an arcade game produced by Konami in 1989.
