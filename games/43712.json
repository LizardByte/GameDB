If you're feeling creative, you can also take advantage of the game's Create-A-Player and Create-A-Play features, as well as the new Create-A-School feature. This new mode lets you create a school, and then take its team through multiple seasons in Dynasty mode. You can also scout players and get them interested in playing football for your school by sending different members of the coaching staff to their hometowns.
