From 1990 to 2000, ITE developed and released versions for Amiga, Commodore 64 and PC and the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and PlayStation consoles. In 2011, Krea Media published a series of mobile game remakes for Android.\n\nThe Hugo games resemble those on the television show; in almost all of them, the player guides the titular protagonist (a small, friendly troll named Hugo) to save his wife and children from the witch Scylla. To rescue his family, Hugo must navigate safely through dangerous environments in various minigame scenarios.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 5216, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ahaBb8UIz_4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahaBb8UIz_4", "title": "Hugo P\u00e5 Nye Eventyr (SilverRock Productions) (MS-DOS) [1991]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ahaBb8UIz_4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
