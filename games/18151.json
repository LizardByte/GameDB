Follow detailed daily lifes, see businesses struggle in the local economy and be mesmerized by the traffic simulation. Each citizen is simulated individually, their behaviour is realistic and adorably human.\n\nThink and plan as the urban developer that you are.\nPrepare changes to your city by creating the perfect plan. Use the most powerful and yet intuitive drawing tools in any city sim ever. Create the craziest roads and intersections, lay out custom parks or even airports. Juggle projects, set priorities and recover from bad situations.\n\nCreate a city that looks like a city.\nLet your city grow across a beautiful landscape, without boundaries. Enjoy detailed control over zones that curve along roads. Be surprised by procedural architecture that uniquely adapts to the available space and the local circumstances. What style and flavor will your city have?", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/citybound", "videos": [{"id": 29974, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rJpTulYwAZc"}]}
