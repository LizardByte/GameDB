He sends a magical wardrobe to fetch Simon but it accidentally ends up on the doorstep of Calypso, the wizard Simon had to save in the last game. Simon then starts to look for a fuel called mucusade which he needs to power the wardrobe in order to get home.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simon-the-sorcerer-ii-the-lion-the-wizard-and-the-wardrobe", "videos": [{"id": 470, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "scJXKGWa1b8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scJXKGWa1b8", "title": "Jefklak's Codex: Simon the Sorcerer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scJXKGWa1b8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
