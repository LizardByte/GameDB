With the aid of time travel, Marty is able to step into the past and work together with past versions of himself to overcome any challenge. By playing out partial solutions and then resetting time, the player can work with their past to succeed. \n \nThe game was created almost exclusively by a single developer (me). Besides some minor assistance here and there, I created everything in the game. This is also the first game I have ever created. Sort of a labor of love. As such please recognize it may lack some of the polish larger teams can produce."}
