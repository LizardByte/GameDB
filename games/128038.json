Tasked with tracking down the source of an inscrutable signal, she must navigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature \u2014 and perhaps something stranger.\n\n'My Work Is Not Yet Done' seeks to provide a unique and innovative take on the survival genre aimed at accurately reproducing the physical and psychological experience of being alone and lost in the wilderness, resituating the player\u2019s role within nature as an interloper rather than conquistador. The game is set in an expansive open world environment that eschews the genre tropes of cold weather survival for a dense, oppressively rainy and humid forest, seamlessly blending procedural generation with a variety of handcrafted locations to ensure a sense of constant disorientation even across repeat playthroughs.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-work-is-not-yet-done", "videos": [{"id": 38671, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KmwlUFxTwc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmwlUFxTwc0", "title": "My Work Is Not Yet Done | APOSTASIS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KmwlUFxTwc0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77177, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eKHxC1xLDRA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKHxC1xLDRA", "title": "My Work is Not Yet Done - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKHxC1xLDRA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
