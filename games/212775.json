You start off as Doro, who goes to explore a cave with his girlfriend Femme. A bit later you switch to a nameless girl commonly referred to as \"Minotaur\", possibly because she has horns. Minotaur is trapped in a cave and obtains an axe at the beginning of her journey, just like Doro. Your goal is to escape the cave you're stuck in."}
