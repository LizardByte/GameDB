The protagonist, who becomes the deputy head of the council, chooses a buddy from four characters to defy the unreasonable.\n\nThe main story has multiple endings. There are different routes for each of the four buddy characters. To make multiple playthroughs easier, you can also skip shared routes and advance through different buddy routes.\n\nBattles are command-based with a free move turn system. Increasing your madness will allow you to use more powerful skills, but if you increase it too much, you will go insane and rampage against targets both friend and foe, making it impossible to fight.\n\nThere is also an \u201cEGO\u201d system, which represents the player\u2019s desire levels of pride, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. These change depending on your diagnosis and the choices you make, and also affect the demons you can employ as your \u201cunderlings.\u201d", "summary": "Monark: Limited Edition Box includes:\n- Monark Basegame\n- Collector's Box\n- \"The Artwork of MONARK\" Hardcover Art Book\n- VANI Limited Soundtrack\n- \"Seven Sins\" Cloth Poster\n- \"Pieces of Ambition\" Set of 5 Acrylic Stands", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monark-limited-edition-box", "videos": [{"id": 52736, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gUKlpbYpHLU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUKlpbYpHLU", "title": "\u300e\u30e2\u30ca\u30fc\u30af\uff0fMonark\u300f1stPV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gUKlpbYpHLU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
