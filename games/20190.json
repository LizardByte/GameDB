No mission or quest here, define your own goals according to your own needs! And to succeed, find your own way to play with the many game systems available.\n\nAs a newcomer on ROKH, you must find ways to survive by exploring Mars in your basic astronaut suit, looking for resources. Oxygen, food, water \u2013 all your life support systems will have to be cautiously managed. Build your base alone or with your crew to have a better chance of living the big life on this hostile planet. Crafting items will allow you to spend more time outside and protect yourself. Trade with other players and do your best to maintain peace; you would not want to fight with your fellows in such a hostile environment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rokh", "videos": [{"id": 10227, "name": "Early Access Trailer", "video_id": "k3FzJJxsWrY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3FzJJxsWrY", "title": "ROKH - Early Access Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k3FzJJxsWrY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 13692, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "CBeQMvyFm5A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBeQMvyFm5A", "title": "ROKH - Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CBeQMvyFm5A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14950, "name": "Backstory Trailer", "video_id": "WIjl1xzC6WM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIjl1xzC6WM", "title": "ROKH - Backstory Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIjl1xzC6WM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
