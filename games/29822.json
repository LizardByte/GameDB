It is intended to be a family-friendly story world, suitable for all ages. It is NOT A GAME. You are placed inside a comic world as multiple stories play out in real-time around you. Unlike other VR story experiences, you are free to move around (including flying) as the story plays out. It would take more than 30 hours to follow every single character from start to finish. Archipelago's written content is roughly equivalent to a 100 page book.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/archipelago-navigable-vr-comic"}
