In spite of himself, he discovers that in need of tutoring is not only Itsuki, but also her twin sisters Miku, Ichika, Yotsuba, and Nino, all of whom are at risk of flunking out due to poor grades. Due to his family's precarious economic situation, which leads him to keep expenses down even on meals, Futaro is forced to accept the assignment.
