While similar to most shooters, Omega Fighter was unique in its gameplay, level and enemy focus: rather than flying over multiple levels, the player faced up against an enormous space battle cruiser which contained every level.\n\nTaking place in the future, an enormous alien battle cruiser/space craft carrier has attacked the Earth. The Earth's only defense lies in small fighter craft wielding great firepower with the mission of dismantling the cruiser one portion at a time before it lands.\n\nPlayers were briefed before every mission to destroy specific parts of the enormous ship. Destroying these parts of the ship would actually play some significance on the game's ending, but overall contributed to the player's score. The game has a unique scoring aspect that awarded the player for destroying enemies at point blank range.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/omega-fighter"}
