In Climber you play the role of a baseball player. The baseball has been hit to the upper rafters of a building under construction. Your job is to climb the ladders and retrieve the ball. Of course, there are obstacles along the way that you need to avoid or you lose a life and must start over at the bottom right corner. Once you successfully retrieve the ball, the level changes and becomes more difficult.\n\nWhen the game was released in Atari Flashback 2, it was retitled to Atari Climber.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atari-climber", "videos": [{"id": 99244, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AdwtYjiGg44", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdwtYjiGg44", "title": "Atari Climber/Climber 5 Atari 2600 Homebrew Review - The No Swear Gamer Ep 449", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdwtYjiGg44/sddefault.jpg"}]}
