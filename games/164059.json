With the help of voice pressure, it is possible to force the opponent to cooperate. However, this may not be enough for long distances. Some give up easily; some do not. In case of failure, it is possible to use other options such as Pepper spray or blinding grenade.\n\nChoose from an intense dynamic action such as blasting the door or kicking them in. In this case, however, you can face opponents from the outside but also the inside. In many situations, therefore, a quiet action is more appropriate, like a slow opening of the door using a handle, the use of silent variants of weapons, etc.\n\nBefore entering the room, it is recommended to use a camera to check the number and location of suspects. The door can be opened in many ways, such as slowly opening the door, kicking it out or using explosives, etc. Some doors may be locked. Then it is necessary to use a unique multifunction tool to open it.\nIt is a good idea to be safe using a Flashbang grenade before entering. It is advisable to continually guard access to the room and cover the space and corners as well. It is also advisable not to shatter the team too much and rely on yourself more.\nIt is ideal for moving forward considering the protection of the lives of civilians, armed suspects and, of course, members of your team.", "summary": "Tactical Combat Department is a tactical turn-based strategy game inspired by Swat games.
