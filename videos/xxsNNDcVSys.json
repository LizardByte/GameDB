I'm starting over with that one, I am still studying Japanese.\n\nAs for now, I'm going to do a different playthrough, with the original Nazo Puyo. Nazo Puyo is a mission based spin-off of Puyo Puyo, released in 1993. There really isn't much to say about the game but you have 99 levels, which you can revisit at anytime and you can make your own puzzles too.\n\nThe game is my channel's first officially recorded Sega Game Gear playthough, not from a test recording. The footage was recorded from a real game cartridge with the Analogue Mega SG & recorded via ElGato HD60S.\n\n#PuyoPuyo #NazoPuyo #GameGear\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon't forget to like, comment & share!\n\nSocial Media:\n\nAsk for Switch, PSN ID and/or Discord (MOST ACTIVE)\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/TrevgauntletNeu (MOST ACTIVE)\n\nDeviantArt: http://trevgauntlet.deviantart.com/\n\nSteam: steamcommunity.com/id/Trevgauntlet\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/trevgauntlet_neu/\n\nLike what you guys see and would consider supporting my channel?
