The light in front of us is pressed onto a flat surface, a simple plane of colors which we call \u201csight\u201d. Distance is an illusion and depth is a lie; only through size and movement can we truly tell how far something is. But century after century of living with these eyes, living with these lies, has had us grown used to viewing our three dimensions with a dimension of missing information.\n\nSo, how would we see if our world was two dimensional? Simple: we\u2019d have only one dimension of sight.", "summary": "A geometric puzzle game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sightline"}
