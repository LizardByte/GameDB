Observe what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time\u2026 until something else inevitably goes wrong.\n\nThe combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "videos": [{"id": 80536, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "xawsp16oxb0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xawsp16oxb0", "title": "Dwarf Fortress Steam Edition - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xawsp16oxb0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
