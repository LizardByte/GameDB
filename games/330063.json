IS BACK!\n\nFind the magic lums (blue balls) hidden in the Rayman Garden as quickly as possible. Advance using the arrow keys. Use your swords to fight the enemies: press on X to attack (Sword) and on C to carry out a super attack (Fire Sword). You can advance using the arrow keys. Each fight or obstacle will cost you a sword. Beware, as they are quickly used up. To save your swords, return walk mode by pressing on Z. Again, beware, if you come across an enemy without a sword, you'll lose two lives from a red monster, one life from a normal enemy. It is therefore up to you to manage your swords and avoid the enemies. One lum will win you one life. Watch out for the black hole which warrants a return penalty. But above all else you are being chased by your mortal enemy - Dark Rayman. Do not let yourself be caught or you're dead!\n\nNew features:\n\n10 locations: Forest (Garden), Swamp (Garden), Mountain (Garden), Plant (Garden), Wood (Garden), Volcano (Garden), Candy (Rayman 1), Pirate Ship (Rayman 2: The Great Escape), Nuthouse (Rayman: The Animated Series) and Bowling (Rayman Bowling 2 by Ryemanni);", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-garden-plus", "videos": [{"id": 139318, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "0nzOC0fFi7o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nzOC0fFi7o", "title": "Rayman Garden PLUS - 1ST ANNIVERSARY Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0nzOC0fFi7o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 139316, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "dxA-_IElWcs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxA-_IElWcs", "title": "Rayman Garden PLUS for PC - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dxA-_IElWcs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 139317, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "0KsWHuBn3LQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KsWHuBn3LQ", "title": "Rayman Garden PLUS for J2ME - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0KsWHuBn3LQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 139319, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "9i8UwNubzj4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i8UwNubzj4", "title": "Rayman Garden PLUS: Story Mode Update - First Look Trailer | Rayman Alive x RUNI Showcase 2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9i8UwNubzj4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
