Avalon is a Role-Playing World, a mythological environment in which you can develop your own character and interact with other real-life and imaginary beings. A continent of legends, both of the past and in the making, Avalon allows you to become part of an endlessly unfolding tale. Most importantly you play out your role alongside other real people, whose characters may help or hinder your progress through the land.\n\nEvery character in Avalon has freedom of choice in their actions. Each character forms a part of an evolving world. You may select a Guild for tutoring in skills, produce potions with alchemists of Mercinae or forge weapons in the smithies of Thakria. You may build your reputation and become a respected or feared member of society. All the while you are part of the unfolding history of a world in w hich you can play a major or even guiding part. Your journey is that of enlightenment, your quest to one day touch the divine.\n\nThere are a few things, though, that you should be aware of when entering the land of Avalon. It cannot be compared with any other computer game. The depth and complexity of Avalon is unrivalled. This level of game design has not been achieved without some sacrifice, unfortunately. Avalon can appear overwhelming at first, and it takes a typical player a few hours to become used to the style of game. It is no short-term game. It is the nature of the game that its appeal is lasting and durable, rather than a short-term buzz from flashy graphics and sounds.", "summary": "A fantasy game world of magnificent proportions unfolds before you: it is the heavy sea-town air of Mercinae, the sound of waves crashing against Parrius, great dark spires piercing the sky of Thakria. This roleplaying world, which existed before the Internet and was the first online RPG game ever, thrives because of its unique world. Great sorcerers, war that can tumble years of real life history in a day, magic that can see beyond time, rituals and vast events that raise mortals to become gods! Avalon's scope is nearly infinite and anything within its walls is possible. As a text-based RPG, it will exceed all expectations: adventurers, merchants, politicians, fighters, forest-loving druids, all cohabitate in this rich, vibrant and brutal world.\n\nAvalon is an online RPG game that has always been ahead of its time. It innovates in the most remarkable ways, inventing new mechanics that you will not see anywhere else for years. Above all else, Avalon is a fair meritocracy. You may quicken your pace but you cannot achieve excellence without deserving it and excellence in any area takes time. It is an environment unlike any other, where players decide the course of history. Find any online roleplaying game today that can match Zaphod of Avalon, who 25 years ago and still sometimes today, will be in Meeting Place sharpening his axe and preparing for battle. Players today do the same as he, building on an epic saga to write their own names into this legendary world.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/avalon--3"}
