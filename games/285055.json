It has the dual capacity to supply power and transmit information. However, contact with its overwhelming power destroys the integrity of the human body. Despite this danger, Q-Bits have the potential to improve technology performance and render other energy sources obsolete.\n\nTo interact with Q-Bits, Cybermask developed the Multi-Interface Neural Device (M.I.N.D.), allowing humans to transfer their consciousness directly to the OverNet. There, they manifest as OverKnights, avatars made of data. However, only 1% of the population is compatible with the M.I.N.D., prompting the ZOI to identify and provide compatible individuals with the necessary resources for exploration.\n\nAt the heart of the Institute lies the only portal to the Overnet yet discovered. OverKnights equipped with a M.I.N.D. can access this portal, leading to a replica of the institute within the Overnet a digital hub for all OverKnights operations.\n\nAll individuals equipped with a M.I.N.D. have autonomy over its use. However, they are encouraged to participate in controlled battles to study Q-Bits and improve their usability. OverKnights are ranked based on their performance in battles and rewarded accordingly.\n\nIn these battles, the M.I.N.D. manifests as a collection of 40 cards representing various actions, reactions, and artifacts. Players have the agency to customize their cards by combining different effects, costs, and conditions. Additionally, OverKnights can equip armored suits with various abilities to match their gameplay style.\n\nWhen OverKnights are defeated in battle, their consciousness is safely returned to their real-life body before integration with the Overnet, preventing them from becoming ethereal entities.", "summary": "Forge a legendary legacy in this electrifying free-to-play Collectible Card Game where you can create your own characters, craft your cards to build perfect decks and engage in epic battles as you rise to become the supreme OverKnight.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/overnet"}
