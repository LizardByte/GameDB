Gameplay is simple. There are 30 kids to pick on a team, and many custom color teams to create. You also get to be in two game types: Single in which you play one small game and Season play, in which you play for a whole a lot of time and features you playing against some unusable custom teams.. This game also includes a practice mode to help you get used to the kicking in the game, and also shows what it is like during a penalty. All rules to soccer including fouls and hat tricks, are included in the game. When picking the kids on your team you will want to read about how good they are - don't just pick a kid cause they look cool.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/backyard-soccer"}
