While the game is quite short compared with other similar games, its difficulty comes from little to no dialogue in the game at all and you have to fumble around finding random items and use them in ways that don't always make sense.   The UI is also quite cumbersome and I'm constantly getting into a muddle with it.\n\nThe game was developed along side the Amiga version and each version seems to have a unique art style and colour palette so some scenes can look quite different.  Items are also in slightly different places. in game music is also in the pc version.  Interestingly the game has a low detail mode (Which I recorded a lot of accidentally so had to start again).  Some random animations don't play like water droplet in dungeon, no volcano rain to burn you, no electrical animation on the floor trap and no wind effect in the town.\n\nThe ice fortress gave me significant trouble with its random door openings triggered by a dice throw just wasn't going my way.  So if you notice the music jump in that section its due to be trimming it down massively. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4fjvZLXVDM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4fjvZLXVDM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4fjvZLXVDM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4fjvZLXVDM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Longplay [497] Curse of Enchantia", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nThe first point and click adventure from Core Design.
