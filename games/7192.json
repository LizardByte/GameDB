Famitsu revealed that the battle system featured four party members, and was more team-oriented. The game also features more of a sci-fi emphasis than past titles with the ability to control your own ship. This ship is quite large, and is able to land on at least 5 planets or other space-based destinations. Players are able to travel through the \"star ocean,\" jumping across planets. The game takes place a few centuries before the original Star Ocean (around S.D. 10, or approximately 2087 AD). The game's plot revolves around Edge and his crew combating a mysterious threat called the \"Grigori\".\n\nAn international version of the game was released by Square Enix as a worldwide PlayStation 3-exclusive on February 9, 2010. Officially known as Star Ocean: The Last Hope International, the game contains both Japanese and English voices as well as new content that is exclusive to the international version of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
