What's more, he has also kidnapped their girlfriends. To rescue them, you must guide Bub, or Bub and Bob if you're playing two player, through 200 levels of bubble blowing fun. Trap enemies in bubbles and then pop then.\n\nThis conversion retains pretty much everything from the original arcade game and adds a few extra secret rooms. Additionally, whereas the arcade game had 100 levels, this one has 200, although the second batch of 100 levels are mostly tougher versions of the first batch. \n\nAs a disclaimer, to put together this video I had to use a number of save states. The intention of the video is to show the game played from start to finish. No other tools to assist in gameplay were used.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NdbYy6uKeoY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NdbYy6uKeoY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NdbYy6uKeoY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Bubble Bobble - Sega Master System playthrough", "description": "A fantastic conversion of a great game, this is Bubble Bobble on the Sega Master System.\n\nBub and Bob have been turned into dragons by the evil Baron Von Blubba.
