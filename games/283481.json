Will you gather the resources you need to expand your home beyond what contemporary craftsmanship allows? Or will you spend your time fishing for a legendary lunker?\n\nNo two routes play exactly the same, and you can take on whichever you want\u2014or even all of them at once\u2014while also completing optional quests for a variety of townsfolk.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alchemist-quest"}
