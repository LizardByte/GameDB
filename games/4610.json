City Connection was remarkable for its time in that each location had its own background and music which was a variation on the main theme of the game. There are twelve locations: Manhattan, the Grand Canyon, Easter Island, Paris, Neuschwanstein Castle, London, Sydney, Egyptian temples, and cities in India, Holland, China and Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-connection", "videos": [{"id": 23991, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4BgudbyWZoE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BgudbyWZoE", "title": "City Connection (ARCADE)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4BgudbyWZoE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
