Napoleon Bonaparte hoped to destroy the coalition armies arrayed against him by means of a quick, decisive campaign. His plan was to defeat in detail each of his main antagonists, the Anglo-Allied army under Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington, and the Prussian army under Generalfeldmarschall Gebhard Leberecht Fuerst Bluecher von Wahlstatt. While this campaign encompassed several months of the spring and summer of 1815, and ranged all along the wide flung frontiers of France, the four days of the Waterloo campaign, from the crossing of the Netherlands border by Napoleon's Arm\u00e9e du Nord on 15 June, the indecisive actions at Quatres Bras, Ligny and Wavre, and the disastrous French defeat at the hands of the combined Anglo-Allied and Prussian armies on 18 June, decided the fate of the emperor, and by implication, the Empire.", "summary": "Now you have the opportunity to take command in this great campaign and change the course of history in Campaign Waterloo, featuring over 160 scenarios with the inclusion of the Waterloo Expansion pack. The game also has several hypothetical actions based on alternative approach marches, and several of these scenarios place the entire French Army against both the Anglo-Allies and the Prussians for one grand battle of annihilation.
