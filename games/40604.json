To do this, you must fly through the levels of warp zones, destroying radioactive beacons. The higher the level, the more you need to destroy. These beacons are guarded by impact exploding saucers. You can destroy these saucers for points or avoid them. When you destroy a saucer or beacon, do not remain in the same place as the debris will collide with you.
