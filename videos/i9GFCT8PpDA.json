It's made by arcadekitten, whom you already might be familiar with, and played like one of their games before (might play some of their older games later on.)\n\nOverall, very sweet of a game I guess. Really love the characters, their writings, dialogues and characterization. I guess most of what I wanted to say has been said as well, but yeah the dynamic of Maggie and Zapper are really well done as well, so yeah, kudos. Character designs as well, tho, mwah... chef's kiss as always of their style. Really a straightforward and enjoyable game.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9GFCT8PpDA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9GFCT8PpDA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9GFCT8PpDA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9GFCT8PpDA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9GFCT8PpDA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Wholesome Trash Queen game] One Girl's Trash (No Commentary)", "description": "=Game link: https://arcadekitten.itch.io/one-girls-trash\n=Commentary Version: https://youtu.be/4byQCzcUMqU\n\n(Just something to off my current awful thinking happening atm.
