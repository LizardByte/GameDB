Played on a single shared iPad, you and your friend play a female or male medieval army and try to conquer the opposing village. Strategic placement of soldiers like the Knight and Knightess, Berserker, Wizard, Archer and Unibird will be crucial to your win -- as will be a quick tapping finger to perform your battle attacks! Just put your finger on the action icon when it appears over your warriors, and you'll be able to trigger sword slashes, arrow shots, magic attacks, hold up a shield, or roll the drum to motivate your team. But keep your cool, or the opposing gender will enter your village, and then it's \"Makra'r Bakk\" for you."}
