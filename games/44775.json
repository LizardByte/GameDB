Boku is there because his Mother is in her final month of pregnancy. The player controls him for the 31 days of August 1975 (In Japan, a Summer Vacation, called natsuyasumi last for one month). You explore the game's area and can catch bugs and pit them against each other, collect bottle caps, fly a kite, or just relax."}
