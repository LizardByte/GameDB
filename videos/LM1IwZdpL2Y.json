So letting ya'll know this will be part 1 of 4. This video is the Full Main Campaign, but I will be doing 4 oblivion videos in total. My favorite being the Dark Brotherhood. Oblivion has some pretty good quests, the main story was interesting and fun until I had to go retrieve 4 artifacts. After that though the emperor had an awesome lotr inspired speech. I enjoyed that. The Battle with all the soldiers was fun but kind of sad with some of the deaths. Anyways hope you enjoy this longplay. \n\nPlayed on Pc (Steam)\n\n\nGameplay recorded by Loopy\n\n\nThis is Part 1 of 4.\n\nFuture Videos to be released in the coming weeks:\n\nPart 1 - Main Story \nPart 2 - The Arena \nPart 3 - The Dark Brotherhood\nPart 4 - The Thieves Guild\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc7b              \ud83d\udc7b               \ud83d\udc7b                \ud83d\udc7b                 \ud83d\udc7b\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you feel like donating, 100% of the donations will be for buying more games to do longplays of.
