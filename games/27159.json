Unlike the youkai whose natural purpose is to attack humans, these rumors are both unsettling and impossible to discern the truth underneath. Since there were no real victims, the adults have come to think of them as merely children's silly talks.\nOf course, the girls are not afraid.

As long as one can control the rumors without being afraid, the manifested anomalies can be rendered harmless. More than that, they can be turned into powers of one's own. The girls thought of controlling the urban legends by themselves as a necessary measure for keeping people from harm.\n\nThis had indeed been true.
