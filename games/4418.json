The game is played with an eight-way joystick and two buttons (a shot and a bomb button) through five large levels and their bosses (which then loop forever, at higher difficulties).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/truxton", "videos": [{"id": 85102, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D9ZidCbO7FE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9ZidCbO7FE", "title": "Truxton - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D9ZidCbO7FE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
