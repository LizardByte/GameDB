It is a side-scrolling shooter that puts players at the controls of a six-wheeled moon rover that can jump and shoot. The goal is to move through the entire course as quickly as possible while shooting enemies for additional points. Cannons are mounted on the front and top of the vehicle, and both fire simultaneously when the fire button is pressed. Rocks, mines, and pits in the course prevent you from just holding to the right for maximum speed. Rocks and mines can be shot, but pits must be jumped. Some enemies fire shots that create new pits in the course, forcing players to react quickly.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moon-patrol", "videos": [{"id": 66732, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uiHQ6OXgP7Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiHQ6OXgP7Y", "title": "Moon Patrol (Arcade) Playthrough Longplay Retro game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uiHQ6OXgP7Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
