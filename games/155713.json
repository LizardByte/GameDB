Using either a keyboard/mouse or a gamepad, you'll traverse through the mothership fighting not only enemies, but yourself.\n\nTake control of Spike (or Sotira, if that's your taste) to fight against the aliens and space robots threatening humanity.\nEvery bullet you fire will ricochet off walls. The more you shoot, the deeper you descend into the depths of bullet hell. While keeping your shooting to a minimum, you'll have to dodge enemy bullets that are equally dangerous (and bouncy).\n\nYou're not alone, though! Through a mysterious transmission, you can buy upgrades for your ship using chips acquired from enemies you defeat.", "summary": "A single-player arcade shooter where your bullets ricochet against enemies and walls.
