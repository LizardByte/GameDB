Upon entering the Professor's vast manor home retrofitted with crazy technology to test his latest hypotheses, players quickly realize their uncle has gone missing. Fortunately, players soon gain access to Professor Quadwrangle's latest invention, the Inter-Dimensional Shift Device, which, at the press of a button, will shift the world around them to an entirely new dimension. In order to find him, players must use the newly found IDS Device to dynamically change the world to and from a variety of different dimensions to progress through the complicated Quadwrangle Manor. While on the journey, becoming adept at utilizing the various dimensions will help them trek from one bizarre and challenging room to the next. It might sound easy enough, but it is a tall order for a kid in a giant puzzle of a manor!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quantum-conundrum", "videos": [{"id": 1392, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hsHLCYGv8A4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsHLCYGv8A4", "title": "Quantum Conundrum E3 2012 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hsHLCYGv8A4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
