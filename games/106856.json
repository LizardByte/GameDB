She is reflecting on childhood memories of her mother and a day trip they once took to a neighboring city. Rather than recalling these events as they actually occured, she remembers the day from the perspective of her younger self, transforming the experience into a magical journey of the imagination. As Miriam thinks back on these events, her emotions surge as if experiencing the trip for the first time once again.", "summary": "A Memoir Blue is an atmospheric journey through the memories of Miriam: a champion swimmer, who on the day of her greatest success dwells on her childhood memories of her mother and a special trip they took.\n\nExperience this personal story through a beautiful mixture of 3D animation and hand-drawn 2D.
