Your colonists think of a lot of wishes and you need to fulfill at least some of them to keep them happy and productive. \n \nLike other colony games, there are resources to gather, technologies to unlock, and dangers to survive. Colonists get experienced in their professions unlocking new and faster ways to do their jobs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/founders-fortune", "videos": [{"id": 29600, "name": "Steam Early Access Trailer", "video_id": "jRq4J8RrNzk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRq4J8RrNzk", "title": "Founders' Fortune - Steam Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jRq4J8RrNzk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
