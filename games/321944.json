This aircraft was the culmination of the evolution of the Fw 190 fighter and Germany's most advanced piston fighter. It was in development for a long time, several years, and appeared at the very end of the war. During the development, several modifications of the original Fw 190 were produced, which finally led to the Ta 152 - the name \"Fw\" was changed to \"Ta\" in recognition of the designer's merits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad-ta-152-h-1-collector-plane", "videos": [{"id": 132996, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wFtungqdq5A"}]}
