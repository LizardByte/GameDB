He immediately ran out of the office in anger. In Central Park, he meets Yume, a young guitarist who, like him, has no one to spend Christmas with. Her cheerfulness distracts Naoki for a while.

She is the opposite of Yume. She becomes shy when she stays alone with Naoki but usually she's quite energetic. She feels embarrassed when Naoki shows his care in public. Miyuki is worried that she is not \"interesting\" enough for Naoki, and she is jealous that Yume and Naoki have a lot in common.\n\nYume\nDate of birth: January 10, 16 years old.
