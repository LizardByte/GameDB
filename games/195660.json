Navigate natural environments through split paths, twists, turns, jumps, shortcuts, and narrow corridors in an intense race to the finish.\n\nDeathgrip introduces a depth to its racing controls that challenges the player to explore the skill ceiling. From afterburner allowed at any time to pitching, rolling, drifting, repairing, managing heat, and firing weapons, one should take pride in their ability to master a racer.\n\nIt is an experience meant to be visceral, brutal, exciting, and intense, centered on offering players instant enjoyment without gimmicks and an extended sense of achievement for those competitive and dedicated enough to get the most out of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deathgrip", "videos": [{"id": 72067, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4UD77ObiK5Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UD77ObiK5Y", "title": "DEATHGRIP v0.09 Combat Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UD77ObiK5Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102512, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8lBF7Nhh8Yg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lBF7Nhh8Yg", "title": "Deathgrip Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lBF7Nhh8Yg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
