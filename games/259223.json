During Plutonia 3's development, there were a handful of great maps that didn't quite fit in a Plutonia 3 megawad but would fit great in a PRCP megawad. So PRCP2 was started! PRCP2 is not as classic as PRCP or Plutonia itself, but we dare say the spirit is very Plutonian and fun to play.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plutonia-revisited-community-project-2"}
