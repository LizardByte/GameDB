Can Sonic, Tails and Knuckles collect the Chaos Emeralds and Time Stones to stop Metal Sonic before its too late?", "summary": "Sonic Time Twisted is an open-source Classic Sonic style fan-made game, headed by Overbound. The game tries to improve upon the best features from Sonic the Hedgehog CD and the other Genesis/Mega Drive games. These features including time travel, elemental shields, and 3D special stages.\n\nThe player controls Sonic and co. and they play like they do in the Genesis titles. Like in Sonic the Hedgehog CD, the player must use time poles (now adjusted to be instant) to travel through two different time zones, Past and Future. In the Past, Sonic must find the Special Stages and collect the Time Stones, while in the Future, Sonic must also find the Special Stages, however, these have the Chaos Emeralds. Beat all 14 Special Stages in each time zone (7 each) and the player will achieve the True Ending. Besides that, the player must traverse through 8 zones, most with 2 acts each, reach the Goal Post at the end, as well as encounter a boss at the end of the stage be it Metal Sonic or one of many loyal Super Badniks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-time-twisted", "videos": [{"id": 37434, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UcLpwUccCqo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcLpwUccCqo", "title": "Sonic Time Twisted Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UcLpwUccCqo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
