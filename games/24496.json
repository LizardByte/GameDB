Players fly a jet across a looping area and must shoot down attacking aircraft. A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/falcon-patrol", "videos": [{"id": 109441, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aRfr-ipQQ8E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRfr-ipQQ8E", "title": "C64-Longplay - Falcon Patrol (720p)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aRfr-ipQQ8E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
