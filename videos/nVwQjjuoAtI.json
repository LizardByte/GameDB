I remember so little about it. It was easily one of the most forgettable games I ever played as a kid. I found the difficulty to be unbelievably low and the gameplay really dull. And keep in mind, I was four when I first played this game, so this is stupid four-year-old me talking. I guess I was a bit of a child prodigy and maybe I was a little too used to the higher difficulty of the Humongous games, but honestly after I played School Days, I never went back to this one. \n\nI have very little to say about this recording. I actually almost entirely went unpracticed. I played maybe a picture or two before recording this, where for other I Spy games I usually play the game one time through so I don't get stuck on finding anything. Since the game literally shows you what you're trying to find though, and since they're always in plain sight, I saw no purpose in trying to practice. This game really could have used some sort of difficulty setting.\n\nThere are three main riddle games, and three side activities. It's all about what you'd expect, I suppose. Interestingly this game seems to take inspiration from both the original \"I Spy\" book and the \"I Spy School Days\" book. \n\nSo...enjoy, I guess? I sure didn't, but you might.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVwQjjuoAtI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVwQjjuoAtI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVwQjjuoAtI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nVwQjjuoAtI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "I Spy Junior Walkthrough", "description": "And here we are with I Spy Junior and...oh gosh did I really record this game?\n\nHonestly I thought I'd never see this game again.
