They are: Daniel Asperen (Level Design), Morris Belfrage (Animation), Josh Dutton (Audio), Luke Parkes-Haskell (Design), and Oskar Selin (Art).\n\nThe Kingdom of Plato once held aloft in the sky, falls into ruin. It has been abandoned by the High-Kings of old, leaving the denizens trapped as it slowly decays and crumbles into the abyss. They are quite literally running out of space - and it's only going to get worse.\n\nEnter our erstwhile adventurer, Cassius who seeks to claim the throne, ergo the Kingdom for himself - and will stop at nothing to get it.\n\nNavigate and fight your way through a world full of devious enemies, and defeat them by picking up floor tiles and using them as deadly projectiles - but you need to take great care, as each time you remove a floor tile, you give yourself one less to stand on, and you too may find yourself running out of space.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reclaym-the-kingdom", "videos": [{"id": 114077, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "g3kfhaZGMV0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3kfhaZGMV0", "title": "ReClaym the Kingdom Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3kfhaZGMV0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
