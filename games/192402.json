The bad news: Actually...things look pretty safe this time, and it's highly unlikely that Dr. Wily will try to destroy reality as we know it with a gigantic space cannon, so there's probably no bad news at all. Just enjoy all the creative, wacky, unique, and unusual simulations the festival has to offer, and say hello to that mysterious figure who seems to be watching you...\n\nMaGMML2 expands and improves on MaGMML1 in almost every way. Built in Mega Engine and subjected to more extensive playtesting, the game runs smoothly (you can actually ride Rush Jet this time!) and offers several new configuration options. The judging rubric has been refined, and judge comments cover the highs and lows of each level in greater depth. A new collectible and many more assets were available to the level designers, allowing for even more variety in the gameplay. Several features have been added to keep things fresh, and there's enough bonus content to keep you entertained long after you've completed the contestant-submitted levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/make-a-good-mega-man-level-contest-2", "videos": [{"id": 65119, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-gAGtlKt6XI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gAGtlKt6XI", "title": "Make a Good Mega Man Level Contest 2 - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-gAGtlKt6XI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
