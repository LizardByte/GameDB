The 100 top scorers will be recognized through an interactive ranking system, letting novice players test their dancing mettle against top-notch DDR experts. Players can also go online to access new challenge missions which will be refreshed periodically, allowing players a way to continually expand the DDR gaming experience. Whether players are looking to dance to the hottest tracks in town, choreograph, edit and create their own dance steps, or use the 'Work Out' mode to burn off excess pounds, DDR STR!KE will offer players of all ages an interactive and fun way to get up and groove. The game's support for the EyeToy Camera continues to add depth and dimension to the gameplay. While using the camera, players can access fast-paced mini games and use both their hands and feet while dancing and watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music, including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as \"Genie In A Bottle\" and \"Oops!...I Did It Again.\" Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-dance-revolution-str-ke", "videos": [{"id": 37998, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gA6X7pjoQD4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA6X7pjoQD4", "title": "DDR Strike [JPN]-Random Gameplay #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gA6X7pjoQD4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
