It was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-chronicles", "videos": [{"id": 52636, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GnRgA9OjjKU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnRgA9OjjKU", "title": "Tomb Raider Chronicles - The Colosseum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GnRgA9OjjKU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
