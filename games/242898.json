They simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of safely reaching their home at the end of each level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers, rivers, and many other hazards.\n\nYour task is to rescue the Lemmings across 114 levels of fast-paced puzzling.\nYou are not in direct control of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of roles which can be assigned to an individual Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target of Lemmings to be rescued in order to progress.\n\n'Oh No! More Lemmings' is the follow-up to Lemmings. The game features 100 new levels, and all-new graphics and music. This port features a slightly increased quality in graphics. The UI is also larger and features more detailed information. The music is also replaced with original scores of royalty-free music in much higher quality.
