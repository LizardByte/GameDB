Whether those entities are life forms or pure machines, they react to player presence, to light and shadow and they may open access to the following.\n\nIf most parts of the journey will require only curiosity and logic, a good control and coordination on running, breathing and jumping actions will help to go through rare but exigent sequences, as an homage to old school die an retry games.\n\nThe main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world. A world which seems to be alive, leading the player, manipulating him and playing with him for any reason.\n\nImagination is an important key to enjoy and understand NaissanceE. Walking in an undiscovered abstract structure brings questions about the nature of this world, about the meaning of this trip. Evocating and symbolic, the architecture and events will lead player\u2019s imagination to find an answer, if it only matters.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naissancee", "videos": [{"id": 22622, "name": "Release Trailer", "video_id": "MN5zri5TmPU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN5zri5TmPU", "title": "NaissanceE Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MN5zri5TmPU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22623, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_6DTjWX7rh4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6DTjWX7rh4", "title": "NaissanceE Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_6DTjWX7rh4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
