Cyrano is the greatest swordsman and wordsmith in all of France. He also has the largest nose and the fiercest temper. He has stood alone against a hundred soldiers and can best the wits of any poet alive, but when he falls in love with Roxane, he is hopeless. How could she ever love such a ridiculous nose? When Roxane falls for a beautiful young soldier, Cyrano sees an opportunity to share his heart but hide his face.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ludonarracon-supporter-pack-featuring-cyrano"}
