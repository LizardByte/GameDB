In this small nation, fairies coexist with humans, while the practice of magic is commonplace. A decade ago, when Midier faced existential threats, powerful entities known as Fairy Brides emerged. Their immense abilities repelled foreign invasions, elevating them to the status of revered heroes.\n\nAt the heart of Midier lies Einsel Grand Monastery, which serves dual purposes. Not only is it the headquarters of the fairy-worshipping Holy Church, but it's also the nation's sole academy for training human magicians.\n\nEnter Sreng, a gifted student whose magical prowess surpasses his peers. His exceptional talents have earned him a coveted opportunity: the chance to become the companion of Lia, the most remarkable of all Fairy Brides. Renowned for her saint-like beauty and embodiment of pure justice, Lia is a figure of widespread admiration.\n\nFor many, including Sreng, becoming a Fairy Bride's companion represents the ultimate path to heroism. It's a chance to gain the power necessary to protect what one holds dear.\n\nYet beneath Sreng's noble aspirations lies an unconscious, hidden motive. Unbeknownst to all, including himself, the path he's about to embark upon may lead to Midier's downfall. As the story begins, this grim truth remains concealed, its potential consequences yet to unfold\u4e00\n\nMore Than Anyone Else, That Bride is the Most Beloved, and Also the Most Hated.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kyokkou-no-marriage", "videos": [{"id": 126792, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CG7Bqow6KTg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG7Bqow6KTg", "title": "\u300e\u65ed\u5149\u306e\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300fOP\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CG7Bqow6KTg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
