They both passed away, their dog on August 3rd 2023 and their mother September 27th 2023. This game is dedicated to them both and may their memory live on forever in this mod.\n\nThe wad is an 8 level chapter starring Joan Dark as she fights against the forces of Hell as it invades the UAC bases and gradually takes over. A powerful demon, code-named only DESOLATION, has risen from the depths of Hell and brought with it an army of darkness that is utterly relentless. DoomGuy isn't around. Nobody is around except the demonically possessed corpses of former fellow UAC military... so it's up to Joan Dark to deal with this on her own.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-desolation"}
