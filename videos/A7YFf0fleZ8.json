The CD-ROM release features voice acting, something absent on the Amiga (and PC floppy) release.\n\nDreamweb is a dark and violent cyberpunk point-and-click adventure, though it owes far more to H.P. Lovecraft than it does to the likes of William Gibson. It's not a bad game and has a great atmosphere, largely thanks to some lovely pixel art and music, but it never really lived up to all the hype. \n\nStill, it managed to court a lot controversy at the time for its supposed graphic and gratuitous violence and an incredibly blocky sex scene. In retrospect, its hard to see what all the fuss about, but these were different times and video games still a relatively new medium.\n\nIt was originally released for Amiga and PC in 1994, developed by Creative Reality and published by Empire Interactive.\n\nEmulated via ScummVM (http://scummvm.org).\n\nSee my gaming blog at: https://thecakeisaliegaming.wordpress.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7YFf0fleZ8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7YFf0fleZ8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7YFf0fleZ8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7YFf0fleZ8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7YFf0fleZ8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dreamweb (1994) - PC CDROM intro (HD 1080p)", "description": "The intro sequence for the PC-CDROM version of Dreamweb, where Ryan learns of his of his gruesome mission to kill \"the seven\" via a surreal dream.
