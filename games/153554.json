They'll stop at nothing to fulfil their quest of smearing themselves on some bread, but these fillings have chosen the wrong loaf to mess with. Loaf happens to have a scream so powerful that it can shatter jam jars, melt butter, and explode cheese!\n\nEach level has you control Loaf with the objective to destroy all enemies. The game is played using 5 buttons; move left, move right, scream, jump, and drop a slice. Different enemies have different strengths, so some may require multiple screams to eliminate. Screaming is not only good for damaging enemies, Loaf's scream can also push levers and propel himself across water. Loaf is made up of 5 slices, Loaf has the ability to leave slices behind and re-join with them later, any dropped slices will scream at the same time as the control slice. More points are scored for completing levels quickly, so dropping slices in next to where enemies are about to spawn is useful to defeat them more efficiently. Dropping slices plays a big part in puzzle solving too. Slices also act as health, a slice is lost from Loaf upon enemy collision. Beware though, each slice you drop gives Loaf one less slice of protection. You will fail the level when you lose your control slice.\n\nWill you manage to save Loaf from becoming a sandwich?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/screaming-loaf", "videos": [{"id": 51527, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UjsJOQhXg6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjsJOQhXg6g", "title": "Screaming Loaf: Android Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UjsJOQhXg6g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
