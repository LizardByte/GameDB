According to legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe. Your mission is to infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces.", "summary": "Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3-D. It is a first-person shooter that uses the same engine and has the same gameplay, however the game is not divided into 6 separate episodes - all the levels are one long episode. The enemies and weapons are pretty much the same as in Wolfenstein 3-D. Only new additions include: new bosses, a new type of enemy, and a new pickup (a large box of ammo).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spear-of-destiny", "videos": [{"id": 34425, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lS6uFMGSdD8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS6uFMGSdD8", "title": "Spear of Destiny - Floor 1 (1992) [MS-DOS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 47, "name": "Wolfenstein"}]}
