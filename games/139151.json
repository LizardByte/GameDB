It does not exist to amuse you. It is meant to train prospective football coaches in the art and science of managing the travails of the offseason. \n \nAny fun you may have, or amusement you may find, while piloting this simulator is purely accidental, and should be reported as a software bug. \n \nThis \"video game,\" if you would like to call it that, is not about fun and games. It is about getting dressed, resetting the clock on your car radio, shopping at the hardware store, and accomplishing offseason tasks. In other words, it is the exact sort of game Bill Belichick might himself make. \n \nThis game is possible to beat, but you may find it frustrating and difficult at times. That is because you are not Bill Belichick.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bill-belichick-offseason-simulator"}
