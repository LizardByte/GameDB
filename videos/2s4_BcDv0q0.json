She is a little girl that never grows up and lives with no adults in Villa Villekulla, an abandoned house, with a horse (with no name) and a monkey, Mr. Nilsson. She says her mother is in heaven and her father is king of a pacific island. But who really knows? The original stories, written by Astrid Lindgren since 1945, were adapted into films and television series. Here, is a computerized version where children will discover her little world. First, they'll have to enter Villa Villekulla, by the door, of course.\n\nPlayers will explore the rooms in the Villa (hall, kitchen, bureau, bedroom, and attic) and solve different types of puzzles (i.e. jigsaw, memory). There's also a book activity where children can choose among three books and start these stories with screen texts that can be turned on or off. Texts are available in twelve (say, eleven because of British/American english) different languages.\n\n-- Source:  https://www.mobygames.com/game/pippi#docs --\n\n\u00a9 1995, 1996 Ahead Multimedia AB \nand Astrid Lindgren and Ingrid Vang Nyman\nLicensed by Nordic Licensing AB\nCredits:\nCopyrights\nAstrid Lindgren, Ingrid Vang Nyman\nLicense\nNordic Licensing AB\nProduced by\nAhead Multimedia\nProduction Team\nExecutive Producer\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bodin\nAnimation\nClaes Stridsberg\nProgramming\nAnders Silv\u00e9n\nSound\nAnders Melin\nStoryboard\nKristina Lystad\nVoice Over Directors\nGloria Charles (Am.
