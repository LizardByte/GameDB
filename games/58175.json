Flaithis and Annwn have been at war for many years, and it isn't any surprise that the peaceful Rirudahna, which falls between the two, would be drug into the battle.\n\nA young boy, Liam, who is a student on Rirudahna, is visited by Lugh, the angelic ruler of Flaithis, to find fragrances and mix a perfume with the power to bring the holy forces and demonic forces together in mediation and thus bring peace, and Liam accepts this task. He is visited by angels from Flaithis that aid him in bringing him the scents of their homeland to help his quest, but the demons of Annwn also find out about this plot, and decide to work their own strategy against it, also visiting Liam and bringing him the fragrances of Annwn.\n\nCan Liam create the peace-bringing legendary fragrance \"Naveri\"? Or will he instead find himself falling for one of his angelic or demonic visitors?", "summary": "A visual novel for PlayStation 2, PC and SEGA Dreamcast.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fragrance-tale", "videos": [{"id": 69544, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "ybRcm-vWsoU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybRcm-vWsoU", "title": "Fragrance Tale.avi", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ybRcm-vWsoU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
