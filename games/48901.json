The hack includes 15 hacks of Battle City, each labeled from A to N. Each of these hacks have a combination of new levels with different enemy waves. Enemy tanks have mixed abilities, like small tanks have armor like large tanks, large tanks appear without armor. New powerups are available, like the gun icon that instantly buffs the player tank and the ship icon where the player can move on water. Beware! Enemy tanks can pickup the powerups, too!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tank-1990", "videos": [{"id": 109923, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "by4sUc_dMrI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by4sUc_dMrI", "title": "Tank 1990 (FC \u00b7 Famicom / NES) unlicensed Mod | 1-loop \"Tank N\" (setting 15-28) session for 1 Player", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/by4sUc_dMrI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
