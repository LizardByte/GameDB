No emulation here!\n\nThere are quite a lot of slight differences in the Arcade version of Time Crisis II. Of course, there is a different HUD, and all graphics looking different, far more colourful than the PS2 version. The scoring for the bonus enemies is sometimes higher on the arcade. But the combo timer is shorter in the arcade version, and it feels harder to hit enemies, which makes it harder to maintain the no miss hit bonus. Also, the stage 2 boss swings the rocket around differently, and the time bonuses aren't the same too. At least I have the arcade version of Time Crisis 2 now!\n\n\nThese differences made it take a while for me to reach 2 million. I aim to also reach and exceed 2 million while doing the stage 2 bonus route, which I know I'm still not doing! I'd like to return to the PS2 version to see what I can do with what I've learned since getting the arcade.\n\nThanks for watching\n-Smraedis\n\nIf you like this video, then maybe you'd like my Time Crisis 1 video, also captured from the arcade machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPsCvo_7lHs\n\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:21 - Stage 1\n1:10 - Stage 1 - Area 1 \n2:54 - Stage 1 - Area 2\n5:17 - Stage 1 - Area 3\n7:01 - Stage 2\n7:22 - Stage 2 - Area 1\n9:29 - Stage 2 - Area 2\n11:59 - Stage 2 - Area 3\n13:29 - Stage 3\n14:11 - Stage 3 - Area 1\n16:23 - Stage 3 - Area 2\n17:35 - Stage 3 - Area 3\n20:16 - Ending", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPo9DL73xdQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPo9DL73xdQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPo9DL73xdQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPo9DL73xdQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPo9DL73xdQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Time Crisis 2 (Arcade) 2,065,660", "description": "Watch my Time Crisis 2 / \u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b92 completion, recorded in high quality right from the arcade cabinet!\n\nLike my Time Crisis 1 Arcade run, I'm playing on the actual arcade with the arcade controls.
