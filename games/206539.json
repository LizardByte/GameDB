It would have explained the origin of the Master Sword and featured Sheik as the main protagonist rather than Link.\n\nThe game became known through the concept art being found on the internet through the original artist's web page, which was later taken down. After further research it was discovered that the game was being developed by Retro Studios as a concept, being greenlit by Nintendo to become a prototype, which didn't get approved.\n\nThe gameplay seems to have involved an arcade-like whack-a-mole-inspired movement with the Wii Remote to fight against enemies (with wolves being the first ones programmed in the game).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-x--2"}
