As you explore each world, you will encounter different abilities that will help you clear the levels; finish exploring the world to claim the ability for good. Then, take on the challenge to see if you can clear the world from start to finish with a limited number of lives. Once you beat all four of the challenges, you will unlock the final world and the final challenge, Space, which will test your platforming skills. Think you can beat the final frontier?"}
