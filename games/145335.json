Featuring hundreds of lines of bizarre, witty, and frankly unhinged dialogue, contemplate existential questions as you consider (and at times, revel in) your new life as a banana in space.\n\nWill you find out what went wrong? You'll try. Are you destined to remain fruit forever? That just seems impractical honestly, so I hope not.", "summary": "Take control of aerospace scientist turned banana as you attempt to retrace your steps across 8 unique, punishing levels through this seemingly abandoned space station.\n\n\"Flight\" your way through various obstacles from floating crates to spinny things, plus doors and buttons, which would be fine if you had hands to operate them... but you don't, so there's that. International Space Banana features painfully accurate physics simulations, battle against the seemingly endless impossibility of the trajectory of curved objects moving in zero-gravity.\n\nAs though life as a banana in space isn't rough enough, add insult to injury as you attempt to take on the most basic of tasks such as passing through automatic doorways before they close, problem solving your way through (not very) complex obstacle courses and more.\n\nAll you really have to do is generate enough applied force to worm your way through a maze of literal junk. Don't even worry about drag because you know, it's space, so that's one less mountain to climb, just get yourself to the control station.\nIt really could not be simpler.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/international-space-banana", "videos": [{"id": 47634, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "fY4AwmzCj3Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY4AwmzCj3Y", "title": "International Space Banana - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fY4AwmzCj3Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
