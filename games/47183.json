In the video game, the player assumes the role of a train hijacker who has commandeered a steam train to escape Nazi Germany during World War II. When the train is in motion the player must maintain the correct speed, steam pressure and other operational parameters of the train; also, the player must attempt to shoot down Nazi fighter planes which occasionally strafe the train by aiming and firing anti-aircraft guns mounted to the engine of the train. When the train occasionally stops briefly for resupply at various train stations, the player also must provide cover fire against attackers in the station buildings for comrades resupplying the train.\n\nThe Train was initially released for several 8-bit computer platforms, including the Commodore 64 and Apple II series, on which it was fairly popular. The game was also later released on IBM PC.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-train-escape-to-normandy", "videos": [{"id": 60199, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "E4F5POZfRT4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4F5POZfRT4", "title": "The Train: Escape to Normandy (C64 Version), Accolade\u2122,1987", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4F5POZfRT4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60200, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P1Y-wC8yJ94", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1Y-wC8yJ94", "title": "The Train: Escape to Normandy (PC/DOS Version), Accolade\u2122,1987", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P1Y-wC8yJ94/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60201, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bBUIh_-_AEM"}]}
