Unlike the original, this game uses scaling-based third-person graphics like Pole Position and the like, and focuses specifically on F-1 racing. \n \nIn addition to the Free Run and Grand Prix modes, there is a two player Battle Mode. The difficulty level can be set, and in Free Run a number of settings (such as the number of laps) is variable. Cars are custom made; the body and color of the car, the engine, the tires, the suspension, the brakes, the gear, and the wings can be all modified.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
