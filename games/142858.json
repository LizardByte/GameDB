Each mistake you make costs you one life and after three mistakes it's game over. The timer also gets progressively quicker as you make your way through the game's 60 levels. You have a limited amount of helpful items that can either help you find one of the differences or restart that level's timer. Every five levels you also have the chance to play a bonus game which allows you to replenish one of your items. The game can either be played solo or cooperatively with another person.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/photo-y2k"}
