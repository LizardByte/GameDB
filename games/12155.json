Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis-the-action-game"}
