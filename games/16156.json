The city controlled the Black Sea straits, an important economic and strategic point of the Black and Mediterranean Sea. This area was the cause of constant conflict with Britain, which was concerned about her Mediterranean interests. The Crimean War had weakened the position of Russia on the Black Sea, but, in the Baltic and North Sea, the Tsar built a new, modern fleet. In 1865, Poland rebelled against Russia.
