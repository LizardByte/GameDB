At least, the charter did not expect anyone to actually beat it! I actually thought it was impossible myself when I first saw this chart, but then I guess this happened LOL\n\nTo be honest, I didn't expect this to be my second \ud83d\udfce4 clear at all! I thought my second would be Z\u25c7D1AC S1GN or 11 in the \u25c7 since they did not seem like they are not as technical as the others in that difficulty and more focused on (I guess) strength? Especially since I was so close to beating those two as well! I'm not actually sure if the others in that difficulty are actually possible at all though RIP\n\nActually, I think this is like the fifth time I got a normal pass on this! I played this so many times because I wanted to record a video of the gameplay, but three of the times I got a pass when I was not recording! The other one I actually accidentally deleted when I was deleting video recordings because it looked like it won't be long before I run out of memory space! I should have watched the video beforehand, I thought it was one of my fails *SOB*\nThis one is not one of my personal best, but my arms are so tired! I won't be surprised if this game will cause me to get really strong arms LOL\n\nI mean I guess it kind of worked out in the end because after that I found out how to have keyboard overlay for my gameplay! I thought it would be interesting to see what I was actually pressing when I was playing this chart! It also might give you a better idea of how 11k is supposed to be played! When I saw the keypresses though, it was actually kind of funny because I saw lots of bad habits, which is very typical of me! I'd still much rather have a live recording with my hands as well since the keyboard overlay is not enough for me to show the crosshands that I had to do in this chart! Granted, there's actually not many here, but it would still be nice! Too bad I don't actually know how to record just my hands and keyboard and not have the camera face me! Oh, here's the link to the keyboard overlay that I was using for this video!\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/nohboard/\n\nAlso, it turns out that I can't use the same recording software (which pretty much came with Windows I think) that I have been using this whole time since it seemed like it was only recording one window. Because of this, I decided to use OBS! I'm... actually still not sure how to work with it yet RIP\n\nI'm not too sure what the reason is, but when I viewed the recording, the volume is much lower than what I hear when I was playing, and certainly was lower than when I was using the old recording software! I actually ended up having to increase the volume to like 12dB in order for it to sound right for me! I hope the audio is fine now!\n\nOh right, I'm not sure if I like where I placed the keyboard overlay! I was thinking of making the keyboard overlay a bit larger, putting it in the middle of the playfield and making it a bit more transparent next time! Are you guys alright with where I placed it currently though?\n\nAs always, make sure to at least try to play the game or just play any 10+k game!!!! or else\n\nShorts ver: https://youtu.be/TnEvYydqFUY\n\n#danoni\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nSong: \u30d5\u30ed\u30f3 / \u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30eb (BACO) - Love & Justice\nSong Source: BMS\nMaker: apoi\nChart Link: http://apoi108.sakura.ne.jp/danoni/apoi/no89_Love_Justice.html", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCHhyuoo5VQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCHhyuoo5VQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCHhyuoo5VQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCHhyuoo5VQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCHhyuoo5VQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[11k Danoni] Possibling the Impossible (\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3 / \u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30eb - Love & Justice)", "description": "Yes, I know that \"Possibling\" is not an actual word, I just thought it would be funny\n\nAnyways, yeah this was apparently supposed to be impossible?
