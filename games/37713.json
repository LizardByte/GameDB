The player is part of squadron of fighters sent to save the world from an alien invasion. Final Blaster hosts a number of features that are distinct to the game: the first is a charge shot that resembles a phoenix and is the only form of projectile that can destroy certain larger enemies. The second is that the game configures its difficulty depending on how many power-ups the player has when finishing a level, or how often they've been destroyed.\n\nThe game was unique to the PC Engine and did not see an international release outside of Japan. It came out on the same day as W Ring: The Double Rings, another shoot 'em up exclusive to the Japanese PC Engine."}
