Life on the Helghast home planet Helghan has been left in ruins, however, the war still goes on. The Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) allows Helghast refugees to resettle on planet Vekta. The Vektan and Helghast factions are living in a city which is divided by a large security wall. The Helghast are fighting for their right to exist, while the Vektans are fighting for survival, leading to a \"Cold War\" between Vektans and Helghast. The story is seen through the perspective of Lucas Kellan, an agent of the elite ISA special forces branch known as the Shadow Marshals.", "summary": "Killzone Shadow Fall is the sixth game of the Killzone series. Gameplay in Shadow Fall is fairly similar to previous installments, though now with more improvements. The game is much more open-ended allowing for multiple ways to reach your target and complete objectives. The player is accompanied by a companion drone called the OWL which can help you in many different ways including deploying a zip-line or stunning the enemy. Using futuristic weapons and gear allows for new stealth gameplay. The online multiplayer mode allows for up to 24-players to battle at once on any of the games default 10 maps. The level system is now challenge-based where completing any of the games many challenges will upgrade your rank. Warzone returns as an online game mode along with Team Deathmatch and Beacon Retrieval (Capture the Flag). A new feature allows for the user to create Warzones with their own specific rules and share them with the community to download and play.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/killzone-shadow-fall", "videos": [{"id": 1674, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ezTaAExI-FU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTaAExI-FU", "title": "Killzone: Shadow Fall - E3 Trailer (PS4) | E3 2013", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezTaAExI-FU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
