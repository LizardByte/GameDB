Well it can! If you design them with that in mind from the beginning. Let's see how I design my builder game to be played with gamepads and handheld consoles like the nintendo switch and the steam deck.\n\nIn this devlog, we explore the design of Lueur, a strategy and management game that is easy to understand and can be played with a gamepad, handheld consoles, and more. We discuss how strategy games are usually played on computers and can be clunky to control on consoles, but Lueur is designed to be minimal and has only one game mechanic. We also talk about the importance of having a \"character\" and using diegetic elements instead of menus and tooltips.
