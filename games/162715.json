Advance through groups of rapid sensors, collecting enough red leaves to qualify, and cross the finish line before the time expires.\n\nDiffering speeds and directions of water will move your boat around. Keep alert and plan ahead, hit rapid sensors in good order or be capsized. Do not touch the ducks or risk being given a penalty card. Use your hat to block splashes and splats from eggs.\n\nOn your journey down river, look for friends and items to assist you. Be rewarded by using your boat to catch fish from the river, denying the raccoons the opportunity to eat them. Pick-up cameras to get photos of your journey.", "summary": "Beaver Fun River Run is an arcade-style, single-player, pixel art inspired, canoe racing game."}
