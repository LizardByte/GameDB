In each mission the player can collect a number of things and can receive many extra points for different actions. Climb behind the trigger and help our distressed farmer friend obliterate hordes of no good cluckers. This classic shooter uses a cartoonish feel, some great comic sound effects, and catchy original songs to fashion a world where hunting fowl is a blast. Great animation takes you through forests and villages, through deserts and mountains, winging winged adversaries and piling up points. As the missions progress in difficulty, you'll soon find yourself challenged to the limit of your Kentucky Fried skills! Colorful, fun, enticing, and addictive, this is one game that is sure to leave your sunny side up.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chicken-shoot", "videos": [{"id": 134431, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "D7xOuRamr90"}]}
