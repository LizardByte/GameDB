However, he's grown tired of the cycle of \"Got to work, do work and then go home.\" One day, he stumbles upon a shrine on the way home from work. As if being beckoned by the gods, he enters to find a offertory box. Having nothing to lose, he gives his offering of a few coins and prays for this cycle of boredom to end. He turns to leave but doesn't notice that the shrine has started to take on a glow.\n\nThe next morning, he wakes up to find strange protrusions growing from his head. When he looks in the mirror, he realizes they are cat ears! He's speechless, but before he has time to figure out what's going on, the doorbell rings. He quickly puts a hat on to hide the ears and answers the door to find a man standing. He says that his name is Rihito and that our protagonist has been cursed! When asked about why he was cursed, Rihito explains that it's because of the shrine that he prayed to yesterday. The god of the shrine is a mischievous fox spirit known as Kitsunegami who rarely shows himself, but it seems he decided to play a trick on the protagonist for fun. When he asks how he can break the curse, Rihito tells him that there are two things he must do. First, he must enter a contract with Rihito. Second, he must find Kitsunegami. Kitsunegami can give him a seal, but to receive the seal, one must have magical powers. That is where the contract with Rihito comes into play. It all seems a little fishy, but without any other choice, he takes Rihito's offer.\n\nAs soon as he enters a contract with Rihito, a spark runs through his spine and now his body must obey all of Rihito's commands! Rihito says that as soon as the curse is broken, their contract will end as well. They decide to head to where the shrine was, but find that there is nothing there. The protagonist is about to give up when Rihito casts a spell, revealing the shrine... Inside, they find Kitsunegami himself...", "summary": "A sweet yoai story between humans turned into animals.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-little-animal-boy"}
