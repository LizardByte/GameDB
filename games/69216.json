Then the Inner Demon set up a lair in a black hole which changes position. Guarding this lair are four dragons each holding one of the Inner Demon's powers. Using a spaceship, the player goes into the computer's \"Inner Space\" to collect the uninfected icons and stop the Inner Demon. Along the way, the player will improve their ship and maintain relationships with the population of Inner Space.\n\nTrapped inside a virus-ridden computer, a computer owner must navigate a space ship through a hostile file system and find inner peace to escape.", "summary": "Operation: Inner Space is an action game developed in 1992 and published in 1994 by Software Dynamics for Windows. The player's mission is to enter the computer (represented by \"Inner Space\") in a spaceship and recover the icons and resources that have been set loose by an invasion, and ultimately to destroy the \"Inner Demon\". The player interacts with other spacecraft along the way, and can compete in races for icons.\n\nYou can choose a ship from one of six teams (there is also a seventh AI-only team), and interactions will depend almost entirely on which team you pick. All of the teams have relations with each other.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/operation-inner-space", "videos": [{"id": 126851, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rN_x6912qRU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN_x6912qRU", "title": "Operation: Inner Space - Classic and unique Windows 3.1 game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rN_x6912qRU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
