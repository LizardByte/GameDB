Will the key witness survive being targeted by the entire city's gangster network?", "summary": "Targetted is another variation on the recently popular anomaly seeker (I'm on Observation Duty) and endless loop games (Exit 8), where you have to survive 10 full days as a key witness to a mafia leader.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, if you find anything strange or tampering in the underground car park, you must immediately rush to the lift and escape. If all is well, we can then get in our car to get to the meeting of the day.
