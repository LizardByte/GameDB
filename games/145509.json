After realizing the suit gave him incredible strength and that he is required to pay for the armor, Taro decides to become a hero for hire, performing various heroic tasks and odd-jobs for the townspeople of Corja.", "summary": "Rent A Hero is an action role-playing video game series released by Sega for the Mega Drive console in 1991 with a large emphasis on humor. The game features the same graphic engine previously used in the development of Sword of Vermilion. However, Rent A Hero has an unusual innovation for the genre. Instead of using standard turn-based battles, fights are in a similar format to 2D fighting games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rent-a-hero--1", "videos": [{"id": 47601, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tcDy7N7PSmk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcDy7N7PSmk", "title": "Let's Play Rent-a-Hero in English!
