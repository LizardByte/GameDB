Wells. it is the year 1898 and the Martian have escaped from their dying homeworld to conquer the Earth and take its resources - and the blood of its inhabitants.\n\nTake either side in this epic real-time strategy game. You can play as the Martians with their superior technology and powerful but expensive war machines in their campaign to take over Great Britain and the rest of the world. Or play as the weaker but more numerous Humans to turn back the alien onslaught before their fiendish plans can be made reality.\n\nJeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds is a real-time strategy game. There aren't any set missions or a linear story-line, it's all up to you. You must use your time wisely to build up your forces and production facilities within your sectors before the enemy can launch their attack. Research new technologies, construct new buildings, and build new military units to win the game and save your race. The fate of your species, whether Human or Martian, is on the line.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jeff-waynes-the-war-of-the-worlds--1"}
