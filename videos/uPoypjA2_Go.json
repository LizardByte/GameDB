If you thought Barbie is only good at riding horses, doing make-up or fashion shows, think again! Barbie can do anything... including scuba diving.\n\nBarbie takes the role of a marine biologist who swims her way through the ocean depths searching for clues and pieces of a treasure map. Accompanied by Sandy the Dolphin, the heroine explores the ocean, fixes coral reefs, collects objects, takes pictures for her printable scrapbook, and plays games that, when successfully completed, earn a charm for her bracelet.\n\nWhile Barbie is exploring underwater, she uses her video watch to check in with her trusted friend Ken, who guards the boat and keeps her apprised of what's happening on the surface. Barbie must outsmart the devious Captain Barnacle, who claims the treasure belongs to him since it was lost a century earlier by his great-great-grandfather Captain Billows. Rather than keep the treasure, Barbie plans to donate any gold and gems she finds to the Marine Life League to save and protect the creatures of the sea.\n\n100% Walkthrough video of the game.
