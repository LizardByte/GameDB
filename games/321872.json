In the left side of the screen is a orange pipe, which let's out Goomba's and Toad's. Bowser can roar and wake them up, where waking up a Goomba will earn him a point while waking up a Toad doesn't do anything. If the Toad's fall in the lava, Bowser will earn a point while letting the Goomba's fall into the lava will cost Bowser a life. Hazards occasionally show up, most of which can make Bowser lose a life in contact.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wake-up-before-you-get-killed-minions"}
