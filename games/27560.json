The game's environment varies from the caves and small villages of Afghanistan, to snowy cliffs and rooftops of Chechnya, to sandy beaches and jungles of Pacific island. Interaction between player and environment is minimal.\n\nThe game features simulations of the real sniper rifles used by the US Marine Corps snipers, as well as other real weapons, such as assault rifles, pistols, and sniper rifles. There is even the occasional RPG used by the enemy.\n\nThe game features sniping, with the ability to use the sniper rifle's scope to zoom in on far away targets, as well as close quarters combat using a pistol with an optional silencer or using a knife. Several points in the game require the player to stay in one spot engaging hostiles that emerge from various doorways and windows. At other times, the player can explore the map freely.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ctu-marine-sharpshooter"}
