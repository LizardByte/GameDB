You're on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess. You\u2019re here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world. She will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a dozen times over. You can't let that happen.
