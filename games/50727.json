Completion of the game allows for the use of the other party members when one replays the episodes, leading to alternate scenarios.", "summary": "This is the 7th game in the main Puyo Puyo series, which is denoted by the 7. A break from the previous Fever series games, the game is set in a world similar to the real world instead of Primp Town. In this game, a new game mode known as Transformation was added as the default mode. Five new characters were introduced, and a few characters from past games in the series were reintroduced, either as playable characters or cameos.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-7", "videos": [{"id": 90514, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IOKGDx0dCy4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOKGDx0dCy4", "title": "Puyo Puyo 7 (Wii) Longplay + Harpy%", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IOKGDx0dCy4/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3350, "name": "Puyo Puyo"}]}
