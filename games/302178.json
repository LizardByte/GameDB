Designed to use the .chao format introduced by Fusion's Chao Editor and utilized by krzys2's Chao Exporter/Importer, this game allows you to interact with your Chao just like in the original Tiny Chao Garden!\n\nMore than just a simple recreation, Tiny Chao Garden DX has new enhancements and will feature more in the future! You can view a Chao's stats by opening the full menu, view item stats and descriptions in the shop and store your goods in a new inventory system.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiny-chao-garden-dx"}
