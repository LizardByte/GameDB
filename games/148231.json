It is made for fans, by fans, with no financial gain whatsoever.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the project, Sonic 2 HD has focused on maintaining the feel that has made Sonic the Hedgehog 2 a classic while using new tools to reimagine the original as it could have been were it made today. The game\u2019s art direction reflects this, but Sonic 2 HD has also given equal attention to unseen essential elements in the physics and audio. The result of this is an unprecedented re-interpretation in high definition graphics, music and gameplay of Sonic 2, which continues to set quality standards to this day.\n\n2D artwork is the foundation of Sonic\u2019s retro roots. With this in mind, the goal was to produce a similar shading style to the Japanese original concept artwork and set it in motion with hand-drawn animations. Now, 25 years after Sonic 2\u2019s release, Sonic 2 HD can faithfully represent the original\u2019s cast of characters and environments in a world where technology no longer imposes artistic limitations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-hd", "videos": [{"id": 49506, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "J6haHRbbD1M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6haHRbbD1M", "title": "Sonic 2 HD Demo 2.0 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6haHRbbD1M/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49507, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "RmpIkrl-B5M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmpIkrl-B5M", "title": "Sonic 2 HD Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RmpIkrl-B5M/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
