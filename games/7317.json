It was released worldwide in May 2008. Releases for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows were canceled.\n\nThe game takes place in a dystopian future, where the Mantel Corporation rule the world with a drug called Nova-Keto-Thyrazine - also called Nectar, a \"nutritional supplement\" that enables soldiers to fight harder and smarter, but also induces a hallucinogenic effect, where soldiers are no longer cognizant of the real battlefield around them, instead viewing an idyllic, painless environment.\n\nThe game takes place over a three-day period as Mantel battles a group of rebels known as \"The Promise Hand\" which is led by Gabriel \"Skin Coat\" Merino, with the player assuming the role of Shane Carpenter, a 25-year-old Mantel soldier. After Carpenter witnesses the effect Nectar is having on his fellow soldiers, and after a twist in the storyline Shane then turns rogue and teams up with The Promise Hand to take on Mantel.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haze", "videos": [{"id": 63768, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "buWKc1YBsMs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buWKc1YBsMs", "title": "Haze PS3 Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/buWKc1YBsMs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119299, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y7ZvxUC1RQk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ZvxUC1RQk", "title": "HAZE (E3 Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y7ZvxUC1RQk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119358, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HQsuF1Uc6mI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQsuF1Uc6mI", "title": "Haze E3 2007 Direct Feed Trailer HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HQsuF1Uc6mI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
