However, when the Soulmother is suddenly dormant, the souls of the dead have nowhere to go and are left behind in the world of the living, unable to find peace, becoming lost.\n\nThese lost souls are completely cut off from interacting with the living. The boundary between the dead and the living is so extreme, the dead will perceive any spoken, written, or non-verbal language of the living as unintelligible. Lost souls are doomed to continuously relive their death through their memory. The vast majority of them descend to wrathful madness and insatiable hunger due to this hellish fate.\n\nYou play as Munica, the soul of a young girl, tasked by the weak Soulmother to gather the last of the lost souls that have yet to be tainted and help them find peace.\n\nSever the never-ending cycle of suffering, and realize salvation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/charons-sabbath", "videos": [{"id": 110540, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "ubyEtwhVfqQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyEtwhVfqQ", "title": "Death Cave ~ Charon's Sabbath Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ubyEtwhVfqQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
