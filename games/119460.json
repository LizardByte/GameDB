Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets.\n\nWill you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends?

Released as AKIBA\u2019S TRIP Plus in Japan, players explore an accurately modeled recreation of the famous \u201cAkiba\u201d district circa 2012, hunting vampiric foes, and tearing off their clothes to expose them to sunlight. The game has been remade to bring it to modern HD graphical standards, all while retaining the charm of the original classic that started a cult hit series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 39798, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "E09bMB85gZY"}, {"id": 49647, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gA58t1nmP5Y"}, {"id": 49648, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "epAHCdplOdY"}]}
