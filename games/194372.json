They became known as the Runes of Eternity and Destruction, and were sealed away after Odu's passing.\n\nEventually, another wizard named Drodu stole the Rune of Destruction from its resting place. He was promised strange new powers by the rune, and it corrupted him. The Eternity Rune was broken into six pieces and scattered throughout Thebryll, leaving the now corrupted Drodu to go into hiding to master his newfound powers, confident he could not be stopped.\n\nOdu arose from his grave, and knowing that the world could meet its doom, looked for someone to send on a mission to recover the pieces of the Eternity Rune. He eventually found Aloe, a warrior from the forest. Aloe was dubbed the title of \"Rune Seeker\" and was sent on his journey to reassemble the Rune of Eternity and save Thebryll.", "summary": "Explore the expansive region of Thebryll, a place filled with many dangers and secrets while collecting over 40 different items to aid you on your journey to find the six fragments of the Eternity Rune before it's too late!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rune-of-eternity", "videos": [{"id": 65407, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "A9dilq_kJa8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9dilq_kJa8", "title": "Rune of Eternity Early Access Trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A9dilq_kJa8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
