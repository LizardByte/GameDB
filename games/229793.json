Although it features the same name, it is otherwise unrelated to On-Line Systems' game.\n\nMystery House, or Mystery House I (\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9I) as it is written in Japanese on the box, is an adventure game developed by Micro Cabin in June 1982 for the Sharp MZ-80B followed by various ports for other computers. While Micro Cabin's Mystery House is clearly inspired by the seminal Mystery House created by On-Line Systems in 1980, sharing the same name and similar gameplay, it bares no connection to that title nor its official Japanese port created by StarCraft in 1983. A direct sequel to Micro Cabin's Mystery House was released later in the same year called Mystery House II.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mystery-house--1"}
