Me was remade at an unknown date, converted from RPG Maker 2003 to RPG Maker VX Ace.\nMe's atmosphere seems to draw inspiration from older fangames such as .flow, Yume 2kki and Hallucigenia in terms of its mixture of dark, visceral imagery and colorful, surreal imagery. In further reference to the title's multilingual definitions, motifs of eyes and sprouts are noticeable throughout the game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/me"}
