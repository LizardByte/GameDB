The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual \"save the princess\" or \"liberate the world\" kinds of a plot, \"The Flintstones\" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-flintstones--1"}
