With his mighty power, he slowly corrupted this living world, driving the humanity to an extinction. Fortunately, six remarkable warriors, calling themselves Warriors of The Holy Alliance, possessed the power of faith and justice, stood against The Illuminati as the last hope of Cindrivia. With the help of the Heavenly Artifacts sent down by Aina The Goddess of Night, they finally put an end to Lucifer and his Illuminati Order. The world of Cindrivia then found peace again for decades. Many years have passed, and now The Illuminati Order is about to raise again, lead by a mysterious wizard so-called Ryan The Illuminator.
