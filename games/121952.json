Things have been getting worse for the few surviving colonies of Earth as their resources dwindle and a corrupting algae bloom threatens all that remains.

Your main companions on your mission are ARORA, an AI who's been humanity's guiding lantern since the Collapse, and the Commander, an explorer newly charged with keeping you safe. \n \nEverything changes when you fall into the ruins of an ancient house. As you explore, the memories of the people who lived there come to life with the help of ARORA's Memory Reconstruction system. Uncover hints about what happened to civilization, discover strange artifacts, and discover the secrets of the family whose tomb you've raided. \n \nAnd then find a way out.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 29572, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JefITcxlQRg"}]}
