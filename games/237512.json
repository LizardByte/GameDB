A group of astonished young experts in the U.S. and Italy, realizing they've recovered an NTSC video signal, play back the events of that fateful battle between the invaders and Beluga, humanity's last line of defense\n\nThis arcade-style horizontal shooter by Tetsu Matsushima puts you in the cockpit of a flying bipedal mech, blasting extraterrestrial foes while navigating each level. Not only can you fire vertical missiles and mortars at ground level, but it's possible to move backwards against the left-to-right stage scroll, letting you control the pace of battle. Each level ends with you defeating a boss enemy and watching the titular vessel crash into the alien base for massive damage. Beluga later received a PS Vita remake in the style of classic Mega Drive and PC Engine arcade shooters, released as part of Yakuza 0's Vita app.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beluga-kamikaze-aircraft-carrier", "videos": [{"id": 84178, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "A1Kf72s3pR4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Kf72s3pR4", "title": "PC-6001\u300c\u7279\u653b\u7a7a\u6bcd\u30d9\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac(8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u7248)\u300d\u5168\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3010TAP\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A1Kf72s3pR4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
