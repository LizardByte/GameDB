In this game, there is no moving buttons, no jumping button like others. Just touch to move and that is what you need to play. Be careful and prepare your finger. It is a quite hard platform game that you\u2019ve never seen before. You might die many times before you complete the level. But don\u2019t worry about the death, you won\u2019t waste your time to wait a very boring game over scene. If you die, you can try again immediately so you can focus on your playing. \n \nYou will meet Billy who is a white block. In some ways, he is lost into Darkland. That is a very dangerous place. He didn't know why but he needs to escape. He is not a ninja or a warrior but now he has to fight alone and find the way out. The only way to get out is the gate. Of course, there is no easy life, he has to avoid the spikes, or the light blocks if he doesn\u2019t want to start again. It means the dark platforms are safe for him."}
