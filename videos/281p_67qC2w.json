It is kind of like Choplifter, except you are also the commander in this side scrolling game as well. You can order extra helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, trucks, infantry men, and engineers. You have a limited amount of fuel and ammo, so you have to go back to your base to rearm and refuel. You can carry infantry men and engineers to capture buildings and bunkers. \n\nYour helicopter is armed with two missiles, cannon rounds, and bombs. You get resources, so you can buy infantry men to tanks. You don't need to capture enemy resources to get resources, you get it as time passes. The resources are symbolized by money bags. I got this game at a computer software store when it was on sale for about $20 in 1986. Games like these give you a greater degree of freedom compared to a console game system. If you played a console system, like a NES, Genesis, or Sega Master System those games are quite limited in what you can do. A computer could do a great deal more than a console, because you could program with it as well. I played this game well into the early 1990s from time to time. The graphics for this game isn't half bad either, but it did lack when it came to music and sound. \n\nOverall, this was a great game, and Sir-Tech produced many great games.
