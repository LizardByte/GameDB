Your first burglary - an apartment building. But it shouldn't stop there, why should it? You're making good money and you've got a fearsome organization behind you... what could possibly go wrong? The next job, stealing a vintage car from a garage, an obviously richer family. After that it got really serious, stealing a USB flash drive from a company site? It was explained to you - on this stick were the floor plan and blueprint of a property that you were to blow up? It was said that after this job you would be free again... so fine. Steal explosives and a detonator from a junkyard to blow up the Lombardi estate. A Mafia family that was apparently at odds with \"your\" organization. You do it, after all, you were told you'd be free afterwards.... But no, another mission and another explosion. What you have done here is murder!", "summary": "Mafia Thief is a third-person stealth game.
