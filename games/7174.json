Very similar to both Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires and Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, the game features the strategic and tactical Empire Mode that combines the gameplay of Samurai Warriors and several turn-based strategy elements from Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The Empire mode allows the player to select from some of Japan's greatest battles. In the CAW Mode, the options are limited to 13 models with 10 color patterns each, as well as four different voices. Fortunately, a new feature is added to the mix: the ability to copy movesets of other characters. Unlike Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends, the game does not feature new characters for the series. However, Sasaki Kojiro and Shibata Katsuie, who were unplayable special bodyguards in the original Samurai Warriors 2, are now playable characters in Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-warriors-2-empires", "videos": [{"id": 6844, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YCz5P5Qpv5Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCz5P5Qpv5Y", "title": "Samurai Warriors 2 Empires trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YCz5P5Qpv5Y/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34004, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "GZzhvjLi8HI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZzhvjLi8HI", "title": "\u3010 \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc \u3011\u6226\u56fd\u7121\u53cc2 Empires HD Ver.
