And with it, you get to see and understand ALLLL the issues this game has.\n\nThis is one of the worst skateboarding games i've played. Its up there with Gravity Games Bike to me. I don't even think it deserves to have a great opening song replacement with Lord Loud. But i needed something good since even the original opening music was a bad choice. In this part, we take care of about half of Lifestyle mode.\n\nDo not expect me to be positive in this quick play. This game is emotionally draining and terrible to control and play. The only overall good people told me about this is its soundtrack, and because of YouTube i cannot give you that soundtrack. Your only positive doesn't exist here.\n\n#XinQuickPlays #XinPlays #MTVSportsSkateboarding", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/He2gRND0Jvg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/He2gRND0Jvg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/He2gRND0Jvg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/He2gRND0Jvg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/He2gRND0Jvg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Xin Quick Plays: MTV Sports Skateboarding (PS1): Part 1", "description": "Opening Music: Eyes Have Hands - Lord Loud\nhttps://lordloudmusic.bandcamp.com\nhttps://twitter.com/lordloudmusic\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lordloudmusic/\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/2vValg756xijyRql3C2Zay\n\nMTV really wanted to get into the extreme sports scene back then, because they released a good few games for PS1 and PC and such under the \"MTV Sports\" and \"MTV Games\" names.
