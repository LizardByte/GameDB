It also has the power to soothe, embolden or manipulate the living. The power and mystery of this machine can only be wielded by You.\n\nWill your music save your people or lead them to ruin?", "summary": "Welcome to Island City, an isolated metropolis filled with undead feeders and survivors battling over what few safe havens remain.
