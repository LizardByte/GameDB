Halloween Harry.\n\nWorking with Diane, his trusted Mission Controller, Harry single-handedly kicked the alien invaders\u2019 butts back to their home world - never to be seen again. Until now.\n\nIt's the day before Halloween, and with a grudge to bear, they're back. Nastier and meaner than ever.\nThe aliens known as the Non Human Alliance (NHA) want nothing more than to destroy all of humanity. This time they\u2019ve\nkidnapped one of Earth\u2019s greatest scientific minds and forced him to create a more powerful Zombie transformation machine.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Harry and Diane to save the world once again. Armed with an impressive array of weapons, including Alien Seeking Missiles, Micro-Nukes, Thermal Grenades and the ever trusty Photon Cannon, Harry and Diane are ready to dispense some instant Earth justice.\n\nRacing through zombie infested parks, slime soaked sewers, booby trapped beaches, monster ridden office blocks, robot\ncontrolled factories and alien plagued ships, you are the last best hope to save humanity.", "summary": "Action arcade platformer game, the superior and little-known sequel to classic shareware platformer Halloween Harry (a.k.a.Alien Carnage) published by Apogee.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/halloween-harry-in-zombie-wars", "videos": [{"id": 75475, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KEoba8ABLlM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEoba8ABLlM", "title": "Zombie Wars gameplay (PC Game, 1996)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KEoba8ABLlM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
