Players have control over how their ship looks, design how their levels (up to three) will look, and also create a title screen. Players can also compose their own background music and create a list of credits to give credit to the designers of their game.\n\nThere is also a sample shoot-'em-up available to play titled E.D.I.T.. It contains 3 stages of a simple vertical-scrolling space shooter where players shoot down waves of enemies and fight a boss enemy at the end of each stage. Items can also be collected which can increase their ship's speed or give their ship a defensive shield. Other items can upgrade the ships' weaponry from a vulcan cannon to either lasers or missiles.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dezaemon"}
