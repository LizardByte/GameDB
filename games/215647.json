Pieces move and attack in a fashion similar to Chess, white moves first then black while other pieces impede your movement. Pieces capture other pieces by moving to occupy the enemy square and removing the enemy piece. Capturing is always the end of your turn. Whoever captures the opposing King first wins however there is no check as in Chess.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kings-and-catapults"}
