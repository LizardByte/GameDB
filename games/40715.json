Coco-Cola commissioned a game from Atari to give to their Atlanta employees. In this case, Atari redesigned Space Invaders so that you shoot the letters \"P E P S I\" instead of space creatures. There were 125 copies of this game made. There is no real box for this one, just a flimsy Styrofoam shell. So it isn\u2019t really a prototype, but it wasn\u2019t a commercially available game either. And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pepsi-invaders"}
