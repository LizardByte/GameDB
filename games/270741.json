The player character uses a sword for a close-rangge weapon alongside modern era firearms, but the game is set in a medieval looking castle populated with mythical creatures.\n\nThe game was developed with the ACKNEX 3D GameStudio construction set, which is more similar to the Build 2.5D engine than to the true 3D Quake engine, and uses sprites for enemies, items and decorations. Build-engine like advanced features are used like bridges or balconies that can be walked on and passed under, and the ability to swim underwater.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tyrannizer", "videos": [{"id": 107998, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZZkg7UhSK3U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZkg7UhSK3U", "title": "Tyrannizer (1998) PC (never released) FPS Action Fantasy Shooter", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZZkg7UhSK3U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 99417, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7t4M-tWIQEc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t4M-tWIQEc", "title": "Tyrannizer (1998, cancelled), DOS, 3D-shooter, Viper Byte", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7t4M-tWIQEc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
