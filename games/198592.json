They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2003. There is a single button on the game which allows the player to jump. This was used to jump over blocks. No directional pad was needed as Sonic moved automatically.\n\nThe game stars Sonic who must run automatically through Green Hill Zone levels. The jump button is used to navigate obstacles and jump on platforms to earn points. After scoring 20 points, the speed and level both increase. There is a total of 4 levels. If the player crashes into platforms five times in a single level, the game ends.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonics-action-game"}
