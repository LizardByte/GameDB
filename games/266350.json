The events of 'Big Space Race' set the mysterious Red Comet on a collision course with Mobius where Sonic and Co live. Later, the events of 'Dr.Eg.D.S.' may have reloaded the planet, but not the rest of the world, and the Comet is still slowly moving towards the Mobius, finally arriving many years later, in the time of The New Circle.\nNo one expected this to happen, but upon arrival, the Red Comet released the cursed energy that suddenly changed the world to its corrupted, horrible version of itself - the so-called Red Zone where even the small pretty flower in the background can turn into a devastating mechanical monster with saws and lasers, and cannons, and even more saws.\nNow our heroes embark on their own adventures to reveal the truth about the Red Zone and, maybe. even stop it from spreading across the whole Mobius... yet it still exists.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobius-red-zone"}
