In the game, you only set the initial conditions on the grid of cells. After pressing play, you can no longer control anything. Instead, a simulation unfolds, with each cell behaving based on its own set of rules..\n\nThe game is based on cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life. Atoms, molecules, cells - do they behave deterministically? And if they do, does combining them together change that?\n\nAlso the cell based machines you make in this game can grow exponentially, literally becoming out of control.", "summary": "Arrange cells. Build machines. Destroy enemies.\n\nEach cell on its own has a simple function, like moving or spawning other cells. But when combined, more interesting behavior emerges...", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 52020, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2qiDRz6i47E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qiDRz6i47E", "title": "Cell Machine (Game Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2qiDRz6i47E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
