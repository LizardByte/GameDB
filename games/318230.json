Just as civilization had started to recover, however, another crisis fell upon it - an extra-terrestrial armada pillaged the earth, taking with them virtually all of the known supplies of gold. Society was plunged into chaos - financial markets experienced a recession of unparalleled proportions, electronics production ceased altogether, and people with dental fillings dared not wander out in public.\n\nAn international task force was created with the aim of recovering the gold. Scraping together what they could with the miniscule amount that had not been plundered, a shuttle was constructed that would serve justice upon the invaders. It contained a few spherical exploration pods, which would navigate the planetary surface by means of bouncing upon it.\n\nYou are responsible for piloting the pods and returning all of the gold to Earth. If this mission fails, humanity will be doomed to return to the Stone Age.\n\nYou are our only hope!\n\nBounce your way through fifteen levels of challenging gameplay and fast 3-D action with Cosmic Payback, for the 48K/128K ZX Spectrum.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cosmic-payback", "videos": [{"id": 128251, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OmjGTCbVXq0"}]}
