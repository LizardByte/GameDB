Instead of trying to randomly guess what grid an opponent's battleship is on, after the player takes a shot, the player will hear a sonar ping noise. The shorter the noise, the closer the player is to hitting a target.\n\nIn the 1 player game, the player has a limited number of chances to sink the enemy fleet of ships, while in the 2 player game, players take turns trying to sink their opponents ships before having their own ships sunk.\n\nThis preprogrammed cartridge plugs into the console of the Fairchild Video Entertainment System for more TV fun. This battle on the high seas is sure to score a direct hit with exciting one and two-player games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/videocart-14-sonar-search", "videos": [{"id": 16082, "name": "VR", "video_id": "j89fCrgyC0A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j89fCrgyC0A", "title": "The Channel F Files VideoCart 14 Sonar Search!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j89fCrgyC0A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
