Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ganbare-goemon-ooedo-daikaiten"}
