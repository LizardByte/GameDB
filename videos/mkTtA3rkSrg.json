This is another one of those games I owned back when I originally had a Game Boy Color.  It's a pretty fun offshoot of the Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest mainline games that's a monster collection/breeding game with a light touch of Mystery Dungeon.  There's a pretty sizeable number of different monsters you can get in this game.  The AI for how the monsters on your team do attacks when you're not manually telling them commands works pretty well most of the time, which is a big plus.  The only thing I really wish they'd changed on this was allowing you to have more monsters stored back at the farm.\n\nIn this one I go through the tournament to rank D and get all the way up to having the door to the Gates of Anger and Strength opened.  I also go through a little bit of the breeding to hatch some random eggs.  I've been having trouble tracking down the monsters needed to try to get the winged slime that the queen asked for.  I also noticed that the monsters on the farm don't seem to get abilities when they level up in the farm, you have to actually take them out and get them another level to unlock any skills they have due.\n\nThe other videos in this longplay can be found in the playlist here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZfQAqQCuv56SN95fCbiZpa7-PWJF57h5", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mkTtA3rkSrg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mkTtA3rkSrg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mkTtA3rkSrg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mkTtA3rkSrg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mkTtA3rkSrg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dragon Warrior Monsters (Game Boy Color) - Longplay Part 1 of 6 - No commentary", "description": "This is part 1 of my longplay of Dragon Warrior Monsters (aka \"Dragon Quest Monsters\" outside of the US) for the Game Boy Color played on an Analogue Pocket with an Everdrive-GB X7.
