It shares similar gameplay to Atari's classic, Breakout. Tengen developed a Sega Game Gear port, thought to be set for release around 1993. It was featured in some gaming magazines, as well as Summer CES 1993, but was quietly cancelled with no explanation. A prototype has since been found and dumped. No other home versions Off the Wall were ever released (a PC Engine version was planned before also being cancelled), though a similar (but unrelated) Atari 2600 game was released in 1989 by Atari Corporation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/off-the-wall--2"}
