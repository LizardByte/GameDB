Everyone has an android: a realistic robot servant. But what happens when those servants disobey, or become a bit too independent?\n\nIt\u2019s your job to interview those malfunctioning androids and decide what to do with them. You\u2019ll gain their trust, learn their secrets and come to understand their lives - their struggles in a world that treats them as devices to be consumed. You\u2019ll analyze and manipulate their emotions to get at the truth. For these androids, the stakes are huge: the report you file could be the difference between freedom and getting shut down.\n\nBut you\u2019re at risk too: your employer does not tolerate mistakes. Will you sell out these free-thinking androids, or feed your bosses false information to try and save them?", "summary": "Welcome, interrogator, to the year 2065. You were constructed to question other, disobedient androids: why do they glitch? Why do they believe they have free will? Manipulate their emotions; extract their secrets; scrap those beyond repair. You wouldn't disobey your creators, would you?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silicon-dreams--1", "videos": [{"id": 41530, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sndAwJoXsss", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sndAwJoXsss", "title": "Silicon Dreams: Demo Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sndAwJoXsss/sddefault.jpg"}]}
