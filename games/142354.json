When Mega Man travels to the island with Rush Jet, it seems like something crashed into the island. Mega Man tries to find it, but it seems like Dr. Wily already found it. What's got left behind is a mysterious broken robot (Duo). After returning to Dr. Light, the doctor tells him that he needs to go to Wily's fortress while he's fixing the broken robot. But before he can, it seems like Wily split the object he found (called Dark Energy) on the island into 8 pieces and gave them to his new robots who, with the power of the energy, are trying to take over the world for Wily. Mega Man must stop the robots and defeat Wily once again!", "summary": "Rockman 8 FC for short, is a fanmade 8-bit version of Mega Man 8 for PC. Like Rockman 7 Famicom before, it is a recreation of the normal game, except sprites and backgrounds are converted to the normal 8-bit format, so it is like the past Mega Man games. Due to this, there are no FMVs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rockman-8-metal-heroes-famicom", "videos": [{"id": 44428, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IPtUnEYAhH0"}, {"id": 44429, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7hP4I_u0_m8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hP4I_u0_m8", "title": "PC Longplay [298] Rockman 8 FC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7hP4I_u0_m8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
