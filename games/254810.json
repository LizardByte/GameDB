A Super Hero is here to protect us. You are The Super Hero and you are in command. You need to arrange and align these dangerous Metal Boxes in lines so they can be shipped off and destroyed. You can push the steel boxes right or left to align them evenly. You can jump over one box (or 2 if you get the power-up) if you need to. Once you have created a full line on boxes, they will disappear.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-hero-warehouse"}
