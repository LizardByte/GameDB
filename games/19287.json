Barton then leaves the room and talks to Harris Chapman, an assistant at the university. If Barton talks to him twice, Harris slips his affections for Jennifer and the player will become Jennifer rather than Helen.\nBarton goes downstairs and is interviewed by Nolan Campbell, a reporter, and then he gives the Demon Idol statue to either Rick, a former butler for the Barrows family, or Sullivan, the curator of the local library. Remembering where the statue went is crucial in determining the ending.", "summary": "Clock Tower, known as Clock Tower 2 in Japan, is a PlayStation point-and-click survival horror game and a sequel to Clock Tower: The First Fear.\nOne year after the events of Clock Tower: The First Fear, in late 1996, Jennifer Simpson has been adopted by Helen Maxwell, the assistant of a renowned psychiatrist, Samuel Barton, and is currently undergoing treatment at a university research building in Oslo, Norway, to help her cope with her traumatic experiences in the Clock Tower case and possibly shed some light on the mystery that was the Scissorman.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 8149, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "t1njdpVV82g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1njdpVV82g", "title": "Clock Tower Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t1njdpVV82g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
