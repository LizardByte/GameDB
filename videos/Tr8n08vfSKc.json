Read on below for more information...\n\nCarlos is the 2nd and last boss of the game. He is an unplayable character.\n\n===== ABOUT CARLOS =====\n\nHe is a gangster boss with elite computer hacking skills. Using these skills he managed to get into the CIA's database, which resulted in Harry Ness being sent to Eden, and likely caused the events of the game too.\n\nDesign-wise, Carlos is a Japanese Yakuza-style boss design, armed with a katana. It's kind of a stereotype, and is portrayed quite well in the game.\n\nGameplay-wise, not only does his sword give him good range, he also inflicts generally high damage as well. The special move where he pauses and thrusts the sword has ridiculous range and priority, and his super move, if successfully connected, inflicts a ton of damage. He can rapidly spam his crouching HP or HK, which if they connect, is a combo which inflicts a load of damage.\n\n===== ADDITIONAL INFORMATION =====\n\n---- He has no Escape Dash move. If you try to do this he will turn into a small object, which looks to be a drinks can. He automatically reverts back to normal shortly.\n\n---- He has no Stance Change move. If you try to do this he will turn into a small object, which looks to be a drinks can. He can revert back to normal by repeating the command or jumping.\n\n---- He only has the one colour palette we see in the video.\n\n===== TRIVIA =====\n\n---- The game's director Mitsuo Kodama later went on to become a designer for some SNK games, such as King of Fighters '99. As a result, some of the character designs in KOF99 has been inspired by some of the designs from Daraku Tenshi.\n\n===== ABOUT DARAKU TENSHI =====\n\nDaraku Tenshi: The Fallen Angels is developed by indie developers Steel Hearts and published by Psikyo in 1998. It is Psikyo's second 2D versus fighting game after their previous one, Battle K-Road.\n\nThe game's storyline has it set in a confined city on an island, meaning that the city has no outside contact. As crime took over, the city decayed, causing it to be called and known as \"Eden- the last paradise\".\n\nThe in-gameplay graphics of this game is quite spectacular... the characters are large and have some of the most fluid and smoothest animations you'll see in a 2D fighting game. The game does a very good job of creating a dark and gloomy atmosphere of which the game's storyline suggests.\n\nRecently (at this time of writing), it was reported that two companies are working with exA-Arcadia to re-release the game as a complete edition for the Arcade and home consoles. Apparently, it appears that original game was released 'incomplete' due to time constraints. Therefore, 4 new/unreleased characters (which were found in the game's code) will feature in the complete edition.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tr8n08vfSKc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tr8n08vfSKc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tr8n08vfSKc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tr8n08vfSKc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tr8n08vfSKc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Daraku Tenshi: The Fallen Angels [Arcade] - Carlos", "description": "This is a playthrough using Carlos in the Arcade game Daraku Tenshi: The Fallen Angels.
