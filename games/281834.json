The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marble-madness--4", "videos": [{"id": 106809, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bTtM0QTKfnc"}]}
