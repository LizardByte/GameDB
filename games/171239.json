The main goal is to build a ship to escape back to civilization, but before you can do that you must establish a colony, collect resources and try to stay alive. But once you manage to escape, the next level simply strands you in another island. There are sixty levels in total, featuring all sorts of islands, some as big as continents, and each one requires a different strategy to stay alive.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ocean-bound"}
