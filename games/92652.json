Players wager simulated money on hands they are dealt and can manipulate hands (i.e., cheat) while they are playing. Players can also engage in mini-games such as roulette, slots, and horse races to earn \"cheat points\" that allow specific advantages (e.g., seeing an opponent's cards or changing their hand).", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
