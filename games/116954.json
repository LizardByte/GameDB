This is a turn-based game with the player trying to eliminate all the opponents pieces to win. Pieces are placed on the grid in empty squares. If the player wishes they can enhance their piece by placing another in the same square. When enough pieces have been placed in a square the piece explodes and populates all the surrounding squares. Any pieces in these squares belonging to the opposing player are captured in the process.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/core-meltdown"}
