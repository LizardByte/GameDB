The makers created the temporal universe for their children to live in. They sent the dragons to shape the matter of the universe, to cultivate life throughout. After many millions of years pass, the dragons become lazy, many of them die out throughout the universe, falling to a sickness of time. Only a handful of dragons survive on Earth, as Earth is a crux, a weak point in the fabric between realms. A place where the eternal leaks through, in drips and dribbles, as magic. However without the dragons there, carrying their eternal energy in their life force, (the dragon soul), then earth becomes cut off from the eternal, and magic is sealed.\n\nJust the eldest of dragons are alive, but they have many children, born of the temporal realm, with only traces of the eternal in their blood. These are the lesser dragons, commanders of their armies. Dragons begin to despise their charge and ward. They grew discontent to be caregivers to humans or shepherds to the Earth. A group of dragons, led by the eldest dragon, encounter demons deep underground, at a crux to the Nether realm. Upon entering a treatise with a demon from the Nether, the eternal magic in their blood became corrupted by Nether. The curse of the Dragonbeast.\n\nThis leads to the humans seeking aid of Dragons un-corrupted, Swearing fealty and calling them Dragonlords, waging war against the corrupted Dragonbeast, in which they employ monsters and such to fight back. After many decades of bloodshed, the war comes to a head. The Dragonbeasts armies are too strong, too many human slaves for the Dragonlords to fight against, so in a last ditch effort, they send a colony of humans through a portal to another realm. The Aether realm, a layer between the realm of temporality and eternity, like the Nether, but much more hospitable. The Dragonlords then lock into battle against the forces of the Dragonbeast. After a long and harrowed fight, the Dragonlords knowing they have no choice, cast a spell to seal themselves, and the Dragonbeasts, into a moon, orbiting Saturn. The spell is so powerful, humans, and the face of the planet, are blasted back to the stone age, magic goes away for well over millennia. Today the Dragonbeast has returned, bringing his curse with him.\n\nThe Dragonlords and Dragonbeasts have begun waging a new war for earth. They levy pockets of men, under the mind control of their blood, as soldiers and pawns to gather items of power and gain territory against other dragons. You have been chosen be one of these most trusted thralls, to a merciful dragon, in this endless grasp for power and subjugation. Now go forth, and gather the artifacts of your masters desire and return them with haste, lest the curse take your bones!", "summary": "A team-turn-based MOBA centralized around slaying monsters, gathering items, gaining levels, and competing in teams of five to slay an enemy teams dragon. CotDb takes place in a grimdark alternative future where dragons have returned to Earth, use their blood to grant magical powers to humans, and uses the same dragons blood to control their minds. Humans are used as soldiers in their war against other dragons, as they seek to collect magical artifacts to grow their Draconic magic. The player takes on the role of a dragons thrall, venturing into the wilds to fight enemy thralls and retrieve treasure for their master.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/curse-of-the-dragonbeast", "videos": [{"id": 135150, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3yudnhuaYQI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yudnhuaYQI", "title": "CotDb Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yudnhuaYQI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
