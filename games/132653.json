Having created the Skeleton Robot army, it's bent on galaxy domination! With the federation army under attack on all fronts, only you have a chance to stop Arengius and save the galaxy! Pilot your space fighter through the enemy stronghold, stopping at nothing to annihilate these threats to all sentient life! \n \nThere's a whole bunch of features! \n- 13 stages with unique hazards and design! \n- Engage powerful bosses, escalating from sand worms and giant slimes until you fight Arengius itself! \n- Amass enough turrets, options and sidecannons to cover the whole screen in bullets! But take care - all of them are lost if your ship explodes! \n- 6 ships with different armament and playstyle! \n- Newly written chiptune soundtrack using NES limitations for an authentic retro experience! \n- Does the game feel too lenient and easy? Turn off your shield and turn on Scatter mode! Every damage is lethal and you start each level without powerups! \n- Does the game feel too hard? Easy mode doubles your shield gauge and slows down the level scrolling, introducing enemies at a much more manageable pace!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arengius"}
