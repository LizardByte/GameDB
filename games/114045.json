The game will feature local and online multiplayer, as well as the ability to compete against the ghosts of other players' best times in single player. \n \nIn addition to the competition, a new mode called Tandem Bike will test riders' cooperation as two players split control of one bike and try to navigate action-packed tracks. Players will also be able to customize the look of their riders and bikes and then share their creations with the community for a chance to earn rewards if other players decide to use their designs.", "summary": "Trials Rising Gold Edition includes: \n \n- Base Game \n- Expansion Pack \n- A 16-page Sticker Artbook", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 24722, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sN1va4g8msU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN1va4g8msU", "title": "Trials Rising: E3 2018 Announcement Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sN1va4g8msU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
