You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic. Unique to Ninja Burai Densetsu are side-scrolling special stages: should you move a ninja onto a special space, they will go into a town where they can get various helpful items from townsfolk.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-burai-densetsu"}
