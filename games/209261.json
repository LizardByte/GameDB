It is unrelated to Le Mans 24 Hours for the Sega Dreamcast.\n\nLe Mans 24 is unique among Sega racing games in that the races occur in real-time, with 24 in-game hours equivalent to roughly 10 minutes. Players have a limited amount of time to complete the 24 hour race and can earn extra time by passing other cars or completing a lap of the track. Likewise, being passed by another car subtracts time from the timer. If the timer runs out, the race continues even if there are no players. The player can choose to insert another credit and continue where s/he left off. Up to 3 twin cabinets can be linked to allow 6 player competition.\n\nLe Mans 24 is much more realistic than other racing games of its era, with periods of rain affecting how the cars handle, simulated tire wear, and a day/night cycle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/le-mans-24"}
