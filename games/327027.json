The spell bounces off the walls of the scene, and the player will need to use this to their advantage to hit the rival. Every time the player collects a chest or shield, he is protected for one round, that is, will defend himself if he is hit by the monster's spell. It's a relaxing atmosphere game, simple and easy to play. There are 5 Mages, 20 monsters and 100 levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battow-mages-and-monsters", "videos": [{"id": 136726, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0jZ4HyvJgy8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jZ4HyvJgy8", "title": "Battow - Mages And Monsters", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0jZ4HyvJgy8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
