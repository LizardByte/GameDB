Most colonies are loyal to Earth, though some vie for independence. You play as a soldier working for the central government, who becomes embroiled in political upheaval on the planet Sorgo.\n\nNeuro is a science-fiction first-person-shooter with cyberpunk stylings. It mixes traditional FPS mechanics with gameplay based on psionic powers. The most important ability allows the player to take control of enemies' minds and use them to his/her advantage.\n\nThe game is set in the same universe as Revolt Games' earlier space sim, Homeplanet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neuro--2"}
