Tap it and marvel as it hatches into a Very Hungry Caterpillar. Can you find him some food to eat?\n\nEric Carle\u2019s much-loved character, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has won the hearts of millions of children around the world for more than 50 years. Equally My Very Hungry Caterpillar app has been enthralling and teaching new generations of children in this award-winning toddler-friendly game. With over 6 million downloads to date this multi-award winning app has now been fully updated for this special 5th anniversary release.\n\nThe Very Hungry Caterpillar loves food and fun. Feed him, play with him, and make sure to tuck him up under his cosy leaf so he gets plenty of rest. The more the caterpillar grows the more new activities you unlock. Grow flowers, sort shapes, paint pictures, pick fruit, go sailing alongside cute rubber ducks and goldfish. You can even hunt for buried treasure with him. Push him on a swing. Have fun playing together. Help him explore, pick him up, or take a peek into his colourful toy box.\n\nIf you care for him, the caterpillar turns into a cocoon. Tap it and help transform him into a beautiful butterfly.\n\nThen do it all again when a new egg appears.\n\nIt's a world of beauty and colour you'll return to again and again.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-very-hungry-caterpillar", "videos": [{"id": 132643, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VGVxC6Ydhto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGVxC6Ydhto", "title": "My Very Hungry Caterpillar - Play, care, feed and learn", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGVxC6Ydhto/sddefault.jpg"}]}
