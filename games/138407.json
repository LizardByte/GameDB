When these cyber violence continue to escalate, the consequences often exceed the incident itself, and even more stressful and end precious lives. Therefore, we decided to develop such a game related to the theme of \"hacking\", \"cyber manhunt\" and \"privacy data leakage\". We hope that players can play the role of a hacker, and find out their privacy secrets, like God controls the destiny of others behind his back and witnesses their end. I hope that through this process, players can think and make their own right judgments.", "summary": "Cyber Manhunt is a story-oriented puzzle game focusing on big data, hacking, citizen privacy, and social workers.
