REMIX + is a superior puzzle game that confronts players with a simple proposition: don't fall off their platform. The catch, of course, is that the grid-based platform that they inhabit is populated with constantly moving blocks that must be successfully navigated to avoid being pushed off. New features over the PlayStation original include updated graphics, improved special effects, and additional game modes such as simultaneous two-person play.
