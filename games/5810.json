The game features Hong Kong cinema-style action and new gameplay mechanics such as greater interaction with Shadow, disarm moves, a 360-degree fighting engine, melee weapon battles, and a dramatic spherical slow-motion diving system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-to-rights-ii"}
