Some skills require money to level up, so you will need to find part time jobs such as cleaning the local temple, picking up discarded bottles and making jewelry accessories. Cherry Tree High Comedy Club features a host of quirky characters, catchy music, and is a must-play for fans of anime and manga!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cherry-tree-high-comedy-club", "videos": [{"id": 13365, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "08pItQiNBv4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08pItQiNBv4", "title": "Cherry Tree High Comedy Club - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08pItQiNBv4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
