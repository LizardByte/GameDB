The new king destroyed the kingdom with his own greed, causing the six strongest magicians to seek revenge, placing a spell on the tower, flooding it with monsters. The weight of the spell became too much to bear for the shoddily built tower, however, and it sunk beneath the ground, trapping those inside.\n\nWithout a king, the already dying kingdom didn't last long, and those who called it home vanished before too long. Stories of the king's great wealth spread throughout the land, and those brave or stupid enough flocked to The Sunken Tower, each with their own reasons, but with one shared goal: to get their hands on the king's treasure. Over time, these explorers stopped returning to the surface after their expeditions, but the leader of the team is certain that they're alive, and it's up to the player to find them, uncover the mysteries of The Tower and finally reach the king's vault.", "summary": "Sunken Tower is a platforming roguelike where you descend deeper and deeper into a randomly generated tower that sunk beneath the ground, in an attempt to get your hands on the king's wealth. Wealth isn't the only goal however; you're also searching for the fellow explorers who are lost in the depths, who range from new playable characters to vendors that can appear in future runs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sunken-tower", "videos": [{"id": 84200, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Hszfwp349tw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hszfwp349tw", "title": "Sunken Tower Alpha Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hszfwp349tw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
