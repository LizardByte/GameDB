The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the platform levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once one has fallen into a hole, the player may then use the hammer on the monster to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit or power-ups, which can then be collected.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-berlin-wall"}
