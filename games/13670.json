The player is a knight, Popolon, who has to fight his way through several levels to defeat Hudnos and rescue Aphrodite.\n\nKnightmare was an innovative upward-scrolling shoot 'em up game on the MSX system released as game cartridge. The top-view graphics were considered very sophisticated for its time, similar to other MSX games such as Nemesis and Penguin Adventure.\n\nKonami also released a slightly altered version that could be bought from LINKS network. (Japanese \"internet replacement\" of the 80's) In this version you could submit high scores to online server.\n\nIt was brought without a license to the SG-1000 in Taiwan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knightmare--2"}
