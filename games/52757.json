That's the lesson Vasilij Ivanovich, a brave hero of Russian civil war (1918), and his young assistant Petka will never learn. During their last quest, they messed up with the time machine and as a result landed with the entire village Gadjukino in the middle of modern United States of America. Captain Furmanov is now a mormon priest, the sexy Anka works for FBI, and VICH and Petka have to save the world again. They'll face criminals in Las Vegas, travel to jungles in Central America, fight Saddam Hussein, and even visit Alaska in this traditional point-and-click 2D adventure game.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/red-comrades-3-return-of-alaska"}
