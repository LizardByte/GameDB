He has to find a way to impress his bosses and save his job. And flirt with women along the way. Will Larry keep his job? Will he finally find love?\n\nIn this age of hi-def fast-action smartphone games, I got nostalgic about games I enjoyed on feature phones many many years ago. So, I found a way to play them again, and eventually found a way to record them too. Following the game requires quite a bit of reading... sorry if I skipped through the dialogues a little too fast.\n\nThis is the Java game released for feature phones. Though most games for feature phones are compatible with tiny screens only (176x220), this one adjusts to all sizes, which is a great plus. Since all games (including this one) have just one loop of BGM, I've kept the sound off.\n\nThe playthrough was recorded on a single-core single-processor Android tablet with a Java emulator. Slow, old tablet + emulator + video recorder all running at the same time, and then a not-very-nice video editor = poor frame rate in the final video. I apologise for the slow fps, but the playthrough should still be enjoyable.\n\nI don't know if this game is Abandonware or not. Nevertheless, the title is copyright of the producer.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-slAsO2mTI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-slAsO2mTI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-slAsO2mTI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Leisure Suit Larry, Love for Sail (Java Mobile, English) 100% Playthrough (No Sound) 1/7", "description": "Prologue\n\nLarry is back and in trouble.
