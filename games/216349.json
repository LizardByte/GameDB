Playing as Kevin from the Outbreak series, you'll have to resist inside and outside the RPD, managing the few resources at your disposal and making sure that survivors don't die. For this, there will be new gameplay mechanics, and you'll have to choose carefully what you want to do, leaving room for dozens of outcomes. Not only your actions will affect the course of the story, but also the moment in which you do them, as there is an internal timer."}
