If you try to move in such a way that no move is completed, a turn is not registered and no new number \"2\" is added to the board.\n\nYou make new tiles by combining the tiles already on the board. Combine 2 and 2 to make a 4, combine 4 and 4 to make an 8 and so on, combine a 1024 and 1024 to make a 2048.\n\nGame over occurs when the board is full and you no longer have a valid move available (ie no way to move or combine tiles).\n\nIt sounds way more complex that it is.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2048--5"}
