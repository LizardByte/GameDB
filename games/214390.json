Because of Doug's status as a corporate drone, the only way for him to explore his potential is to fantasize himself into a more exciting life. Doug, as an avid comic book fan, particularly likes to imagine himself as a character called The Mongoose, a James Bond like super-spy. A plot from the upstairs office could get Doug and all his co-workers fired. Suddenly the player has to navigate Doug through the drama and political struggle that ensues and save his office.", "summary": "Weekday Warrior is a mod for Half-Life 2.
