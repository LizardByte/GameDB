Aside from the subject matter, the basic concept is the same as other games in the series. It is played on a grid where the player controls a creature called the Fraction Muncher who has to eat the numbers or fractional expressions that correspond to the statement that is written above the grid. Other creatures known as troggles roam the grid and try to get to the muncher. There are five different ones and they all have their own behaviour and movement patterns. Eating wrong answers or getting caught by a troggle leads to a life being lost. There are four different game modes which decide what kind of statements should appear: fraction types, equivalents, comparing and expression. Additionally there is a combined mode that mixes all.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fraction-munchers", "videos": [{"id": 135288, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wQnWwBqY5nQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnWwBqY5nQ", "title": "Apple II Game:  Fraction Munchers (1987 MECC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQnWwBqY5nQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
