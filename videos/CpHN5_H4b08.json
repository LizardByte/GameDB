Guacamelee! builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these.\n\nTravel through a mystical and mysterious Mexican world as a Luchador using the power of your two fists to battle evil. Uncover hidden wrestling techniques like the Rooster Uppercut, and Dimension Swap to open new areas and secrets.\n\nKey Features: \n\n- Use combat moves for both fighting enemies and platforming challenges \n\n- Swap between multiple overlapping dimensions (World of the Living and the World of the Dead) \n\n- Drop in/out 2-Player local Co-operative play for the entire story \n\n- Chickens. Lots and lots of Chickens\n\n- Player costumes! Swap costumes to change the attributes of your Hero, and obtain new achievements\n\n- \"El Infierno\" level expansion. Brave the fires of El Infierno and prove yourself in a series of challenges to unlock powerful new costumes for Juan and Tostada\n\n- Steam Achievements, Leaderboards, Cloud Save, and Big Picture Mode\n\n- Trading Cards\n\n- Create new custom costumes and share these with others via Steam Workshop", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpHN5_H4b08/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpHN5_H4b08/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpHN5_H4b08/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpHN5_H4b08/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpHN5_H4b08/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Guacamelee!
