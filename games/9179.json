With a deep narrative developed by a team of long-time industry veterans and a partnership with Wizards of the Coast, the single player campaign of Sword Coast Legends brings the world of Faer\u00fbn home like never before. \n \nSword Coast Legends also brings the roleplaying dynamic between players and Dungeon Masters to life with DM Mode, a first-of-its-kind real-time experience in which Dungeon Masters guide players through unique customizable adventures. In DM Mode, the Dungeon Master engages players and empowers them to have fun in a way that suits the party best while creating a tailored, non-adversarial 4 with 1 experience that any RPG or pen-and-paper fan will enjoy. \n \nAs of 25 July 2018, multiplayer servers for the game were taken offline and all stored player data deleted. Players owning the game on Steam will still have access to any offline content including the single player campaign.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sword-coast-legends", "videos": [{"id": 3611, "name": "Announce Trailer", "video_id": "RKDcs7oELbQ"}, {"id": 3653, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "V36agdJxiA0"}, {"id": 5981, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "vKxEkLBLHqo"}]}
