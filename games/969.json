It is non-canon, as its plot is contradicted by the main series in key parts and its events are ignored. The game features three playable characters and consists of exploring areas, collecting items and combating enemies in the process. Unlike previous entries in the series, Resident Evil Gaiden assumes a top-down perspective for the environment portions that, upon approaching an enemy, changes to a first-person combat mode with a reticle constantly moving to the left and right. To attack, the player has to press the action button while the reticle is in range of the enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 673, "name": "Intro", "video_id": "5wmREmO943Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wmREmO943Y", "title": "Resident Evil Gaiden Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wmREmO943Y/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
