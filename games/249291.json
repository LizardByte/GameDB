What seems like a cute puzzle game at first hides a variety of mysterious secrets around every corner. There is nothing known about the original creator \"Samuel Lazarus\", who (besides putting their name in the game) seems to have no digital footprint and is not interested in the discourse around the game. The earliest someone we contacted aquired the game was in early May, where they downloaded it from a link, posted in a thread on a popular imageboard. Up until now the only way to get the game was to get in contact with one of the few, who downloaded it. Now the game is finally available for everyone to explore for themselves.\n\nPlease proceed with caution as the game features frightening visuals and hasn't been fully explored by the community yet! We cannot tell you what you might encounter. Play the game at your own risk!", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/omega-genesis"}
