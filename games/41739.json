The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-ressha-de-ikou", "videos": [{"id": 106315, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YYf9PbvupCo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYf9PbvupCo", "title": "Take An A Train A Ressha de Ikou 1986 ARTDINK FUJITSU FM 7 8 77AV NEW 11 EX 16\u03b2 16b FM7 40SX", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYf9PbvupCo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
