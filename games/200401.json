Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided into three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original, the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-2--1", "videos": [{"id": 73234, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PAjJPnZpOK0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjJPnZpOK0", "title": "Grand Theft Auto 2  - GBC Longplay/Walkthrough #32 [720p]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
