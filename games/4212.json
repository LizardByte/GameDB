Players must create the right combinations of social services, leisure activities, special events and other job opportunities within their cities in order to feed, clothe, employ and entertain their citizens. Be it planning and building a new zoo, public park, residential neighborhood or transit system - there's always a fresh and exciting challenge for would-be city managers and mayors in CITIES XL.", "summary": "Cities XL is a simulation game in which players can build their own cities on realistic 3D maps. Players are challenged to create the right combination of social services, employment, activities, and job opportunities for the cities' citizens. In a handful of brief animations, a grandmother character will get into scuffles with much stronger men; this is usually depicted in a slapstick manner as the men cower in fear or futilely strike back.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cities-xl"}
