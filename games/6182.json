Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero powers to save Metropolis.\n\nIn the game, Superman combats Bizarro, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains (including Mongul) as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. A port for the PlayStation Portable was planned but cancelled due to it not having enough power to support the game.\n\nElectronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh(Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros.
