I have some placeholder music (the song potion is a ruffcut) in parts and need to move around some of the enemies. You can see in the beginning one of my patrol enemies was stuck XD. There is still a lot to show and even more work to be done but I wanted to show and tease the game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heM8ovi7qTE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heM8ovi7qTE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heM8ovi7qTE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heM8ovi7qTE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heM8ovi7qTE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Elly : First Look (10 Mins Uncut Game-Play) NEW GAME!", "description": "This is an announcement video showing one month of work so far on my NEW game called Elly.
