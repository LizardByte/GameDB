Or you can be Jeff. Either way, you're a wacko detective on a kidnap case who stumbles into some hilarious action. Clues and surprises pop up everywhere. Use your head, your foot (kicking things brings great results) and your secret weapon - the spray-can - on 30 different enemies. So grab some french fries for energy and get ready for action!\n\nJ.J. & Jeff Detective Agency are assigned the task of locating a missing rich man, and you can choose either J.J. or Jeff to go on the mission. Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jj-and-jeff"}
