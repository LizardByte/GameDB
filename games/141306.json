Pitifully outclassed against a single member of almost any other race; it'd never be a fair fight\u2014unless that human was a Keeper or carrying some serious Class A police tech. But tech can be stolen, and far from all Keepers are on the side of justice. So how's a nation supposed to keep the peace?\n\nStrict border checks. Pervasive, draconian surveillance, with camera eyes and a computerized spine running signals to the heart of the NPA, the National Police Agency. And the physical hands of this digital dragon? The police themselves. Sometimes the hands of justice grip too tight.\n\nAmong the police, one division dares to stand against the current. One division dares to disobey orders, break regulations, refuse to work overtime, and generally make themselves useless to everyone, especially their bosses, but with the exception of people in need.\n\nThe 13th Division of the NPA.
