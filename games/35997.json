Predestination aims to blend the gameplay of classic titles like Master of Orion II with more modern 3D graphics and new game mechanics 4X fans have been waiting years to get their hands on, such as a 3D galaxy map, tactical fleet combat, advanced planetary exploration, terraforming, a 3D ship designer, and many other features.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/predestination"}
