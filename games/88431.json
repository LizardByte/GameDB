At the beginning you choose seven Domino tiles, but you can NOT see what you pick. Then when the game starts, the one with the 6:6 domino tile has to place that tile.\n\nThe opponent is on the turn then afterwards and places his domino tile and you have to place a tile with the same number of the last part of the tile or, if he places a tile where the ending is blank, you have to place a tile with one or two blank sites.\nShouldn't one of the players have a fitting tile, he can try his luck to pick one, just like at the beginning of the match."}
