One day, everything fell apart, and the world turned into a massive pyramid. Various of creatures found homes on different \"layers\", each based on how high or low they were.

They call it the \"Tower of Shards\" and hope to reach the top of the world one day, breaking free from an unfair destiny.\n\nWhile we won't give in to this strange fate, only a few people, known as \"the Marked\", can safely travel through the \"portals\". They're our last hope.\n\nSince humans are living in areas with few resources, it's up to \"the Marked\" to start expeditions to bring back resources home.", "summary": "Welcome to a never-ending adventure full of challenges.
