From what I've managed to gather by pushing my network\nof associates, the Dark Hollow is apparently some sort of very high-class brothel,\nand its exact location is very well hidden. Even Cutty doesn't know where it is\nexactly, and the man knows every place in The City. Looks like I'll have to do my\nown scouting. I'm pretty certain I'll find eager pockets ripe for picking inside\nthe brothel, and if I can't manage that, there is always the neighborhood.\n\nThe streets are cold and snow has fallen quite hard these past few days, so I don't\nthink I'll find many people outside, though the local watchdogs are on the prowl for\nthese Downwinder amateurs. I doubt they'd appreciate a sneak such as me wandering the\nstreets and the cold rooftops, so I have to find that brothel quickly. I also doubt\nthe guards will let me through uninvited so I better find a discreet way inside as well,\nand keep a low profile. I have no idea what I\u2019ll find inside but I bet the place will\nbe crowded and on high security...
