You can also collect hearts and letters, and if you collect all the right letters, you'll get lots of bonus points, or you might even be taken to a special bonus screen. The maze consists of lots of turnstiles so that you can block the paths of any insects which might be chasing you. The graphics and sound are both pretty mediocre, but the actual game, though on the difficult side, is surprisingly addictive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doodlebug", "collections": [{"id": 1871, "name": "Bug Bash"}]}
