Players deploy all four of their ships to different areas on a grid, and take turns firing shots at various parts of their opponent's grid. Hit each ship the required number of times, and the ship is removed from play. In a unique twist on the classic game, each ship has new weapons. For the solo player, there are 48 missions to complete with animated full-color cutscenes to inspire you to victory! The real challenge however, is taking on a human opponent via a link cable. Forget setting up the board and looking for missing pieces, this is the real way to play Battleship!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battleship--7"}
