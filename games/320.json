It is a rare hero who can reach the very heart of the Zone onto find out what danger awaits him there.\n\nA danger which, compared to marauders and enemy groupings, all monsters and anomalies, will seem a mere preparation to the meeting with something more fatal and threatening.\n\nBut for now\u2026 get ready, hero.
