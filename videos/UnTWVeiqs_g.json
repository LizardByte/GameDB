{"id": "UnTWVeiqs_g", "snippet": {"title": "The Addams Family (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1992 NES game, The Addams Family.\n\nFor my write up, check out the review, screenshot gallery and soundtrack at http://www.nintendocomplete.com/addams-family/\n\nThe Addams Family was quite the speciously cool alternative game to the excellent SNES/Genesis games by the same name, and is much more fun than the TGCD version. It followed the same basic concept as all of those games did, though: it still involves running around the ginormous house saving family members and hoarding money. I loved the atmosphere in this game. The graphics were really vivid and well done, with some really amusing character designs going on, and the music was pretty catchy with that obnoxious digital drum noise. The game falls all over itself in the actual game play department, though. It had all the same basic platform game hallmarks as the SNES version, but something went horribly awry. You'll constantly fall through enemies and take damage, even if you land squarely on top of their heads, and the controls are loose enough that it can be easy to jump right into instant-kill hazards with the floaty jumping and odd response time.\n\nI wanted to like this game so much when it came out. And I still do. I enjoy the game to some extent because of how well it nails the spirit of the Addams Family, but it would have been truly great game if the developers had spent a bit more time working on things like physics. Apparently someone forgot a lot of their high school math before they started their work here. \n\nIf you aren't averse to different platforms, though, the Sega Master System version is the same game, but with all of the control problems fixed and better graphics. It's so much better of an experience. Check it out here:  https://youtu.be/fGP8I2Djlgw\n\nThe video is a replacement for my original that was uploaded a few years ago. I figured it was about time to drag it kicking and screaming out of the 240p stoneage so that the video can now display its proper 60fps. \n________________\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UnTWVeiqs_g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UnTWVeiqs_g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UnTWVeiqs_g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UnTWVeiqs_g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Addams Family (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1992 NES game, The Addams Family.\n\nFor my write up, check out the review, screenshot gallery and soundtrack at http://www.nintendocomplete.com/addams-family/\n\nThe Addams Family was quite the speciously cool alternative game to the excellent SNES/Genesis games by the same name, and is much more fun than the TGCD version.
