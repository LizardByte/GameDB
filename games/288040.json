Their experimental project, tentatively titled \"The Prototype\", is set to be unveiled to the public tomorrow. Both doctors are nervously excited to show off their years of hard work to their colleagues, but something mysterious lurks in the shadows\u2026", "summary": "Mega Man RPG Prototype is a browser-based fangame where you square off against hordes of increasingly challenging robot masters in turn-based battles, paying tribute to the battle systems of retro role-playing games released in the late 80s and early 90s. Prototype merges the combat and collection mechanics of the Pok\u00e9mon series with the beloved characters and special weapons of the classic Mega Man series to create something familiar yet unexplored. The story unfolds in the original series timeline and features elements from across those games, but Battle Network fans may also recognize a familiar face or two. With three distinct campaigns, more than a hundred playable characters, and an ever-expanding array of unique abilities, there's a wealth of discovery awaiting in The Prototype.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-rpg-prototype", "videos": [{"id": 107776, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "lJeTPjMiFJQ"}]}
