We can't\nhave that, can we?On your quest to save your friend, you have to travel across 5 levels, to\nreach the evil Mr. Wardner. You will have to destroy monsters, jump over and\nduck under various traps, and collect gold and orbs to help you with your\njourney.You have a weapon meter on the bottom of the screen, which shows your\ncurrent weapon, and weapon power (1 to 8). All weapons use the same power, so\nif you change weapons, you won't lose the power. The power, rather than\nmaking your weapon stronger, lets you fire it faster.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
