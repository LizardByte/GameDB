You search a massive persistent open world in search of food, drink, and shelter.\nThe game has a realistic, complex, yet intuitive crafting and skill system. Crafting in Vantage is heavily researched to be as realistically accurate as possible. For example: to create a primitive fire you must first create a wooden spindle and hearth, as well as find some tinder (dry grass for example). Then with these items you attempt to create a fire using the \"hand drill\" method. Crafting uses time and energy, as well as many skills which make your crafting easier. If your crafting skills are to low then you may fail at your professions until you work to get better at them.\nYou can brave the large world alone, or with friends online! Create your own village, or even an entire town with your friends. You can also gather your friends to go hunting for animals. You can go spear-fishing, take out rabbits with your sling, or go for bigger prey like Sabertooth Tigers. And if you are up to the challenge, you can get a group of friends together into a hunting party and you can try your hand at hunting mammoths! Be careful though, the bigger the animals, the more dangerous they are!", "summary": "Vantage is a Primitive Survival Game.
