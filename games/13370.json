The indicator is a brick situated beneath the shape funnel, and at the start of every new layer it is highlighted with flashing arrows for five seconds. When all the blocks are the same colour a new layer is placed on top of the last. This will happen until there are 4 layers on the screen and then the screen will be cleared and a new background used. There are eight different backgrounds in total.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ball-crazy"}
