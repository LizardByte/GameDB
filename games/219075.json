Cards being dropped solely from enemies was less than desirable, since it meant that the main gimmick of the game was locked behind a game of dice. This mod makes the cards more accessible by placing them in specific locations around the world. Enemies who did drop cards now instead drop meat, as a nod to the classic style Castlevanias. Cards are generally placed in an ascending order of power; you won\u2019t get big bone powers by searching the early areas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castlevania-circle-of-the-moon-card-mode"}
