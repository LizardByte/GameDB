As with many of the developer's games most of the content is locked from the start : for example only the four first characters can be chosen when you first start a game : Mr Mouse, Mr Hamster, Mr Rat and Mr Guinea Pig. Other characters, boats, tracks and race classes become available after collecting a number of stars.\n\nThe other power-ups are extra lives, power boosts and nutritious items, such as red donuts, green puffs or yellow triangles. Do not forget to \"drive\" over speed stripes to boost your boat, but also collect weapons. These are carrot missiles and pumpkin bombs. But if you use an invincibility shield, no one can use these weapons against you.\n\nFrom the option menu, you can set up sound and music, but also controls and use 8 save slots. As a side feature of the game, the last menu choice gives pet information to kids : chinchillas, mice, Guinea pigs, ferrets, dwarf rabbits, rats, hamsters and rabbits.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-world-racing", "videos": [{"id": 55561, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IwvyrR3NE3k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwvyrR3NE3k", "title": "Living World Racing (PS2 Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IwvyrR3NE3k/sddefault.jpg"}]}
