Upon realizing that she's a cute girl, he accepts the job immediately and travels to Leazas along with Sill in order to find the missing girl, but he will soon find out that it's a case much deeper than it initially appears to be.\n\nAnd so his Quest for Hikari begins...", "summary": "This game is a remake of the 1989 classic, the first Rance game ever made 25 years ago. The gameplay system, graphics and everything else was revamped (on a much larger scale than they were for Rance 02) and will be a product by itself rather than being a part of a compilation such as Alice's Cottage.\n\nJust like the original though, the game heavily features classic ADV-like interaction with the environment and characters (look, touch, etc.) and 8-10 hours in length.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rance-01-quest-for-hikari", "videos": [{"id": 35401, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "6fNlzQmreEs"}]}
