Universe at War: Earth Assault was intended to be the first game in a planned series of games to be called the Universe at War series\nGameplay is split between three modes, two of which are further divided into different game types.\nThe first mode is single player. These are games that are played exclusively by one human player against AI controlled opponents. This mode contains the campaign and scenario game types. In Campaign, the player controls one of the four factions, depending on which part of campaign is being played, and plays through various battles, accomplishing predetermined objectives to progress along the storyline and eventually \"beat\" the game.\nScenario mode gives the player a choice of one of the three main factions (Novus, the Hierarchy or the Masari) and then allows the player to choose a global situation and then take over the world. This mode is split between global strategy, which involves attacking neutral or enemy territories, constructing global structures and collecting resources; and tactical combat, in which the player must attack an enemy in an occupied territory in order to gain control of it, or defend one of their territories from an attempted invasion.\nThe second mode is the standard RTS skirmish mode. The player is given the option of playing against up to three opponents on the Xbox 360 or seven opponents on the PC. These opponents can be either AI controlled, or human controlled over an internet connection. The players are each given a base and a construction unit and must build up their forces to achieve domination of the chosen game map\nHere`s some Universe at War : Earth Assault awesomeness : http://bit.ly/1AZbO8D\n\nIf you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up and share it!\n\nTwitch Account : http://www.twitch.tv/masterofroflnesscave\n\nAlso Subscribe : http://bit.ly/1AAhulX\n\nContact me :\nFacebook : http://on.fb.me/1snDUGv\nTwitter : http://bit.ly/1snE40H\n(For Business Only)Roflmasterscave@gmail.com \nGoogle : http://bit.ly/1AA7QzG\nSteam Group : http://bit.ly/1Dq1HdG\nSubreddit : http://bit.ly/1rXdvkO\n\nInterested in joining a network?
