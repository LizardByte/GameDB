Not much is known about them other than the massive monoliths (so-called \u201cAuric Monoliths\u201d) that they have left behind, previously used for communicating between neighboring civilizations and even among themselves. These monoliths have a connection to energy assessed by the Rings and Chaos Emeralds. The island itself had since formed a quartet of islands, all of which were initially an ancient singular landmass that split apart - being the South Island, the West Side Island, the Angel island in the North, and the Easter Island itself in the East. As a consequence of the conquests of another civilization seeking for power, the people of Easter Island were wiped out, and their monoliths were left abandoned, with nobody having knowledge of what they are and what their usage is.\n\nFollowing the Newtrogic High incident, Dr. Eggman\u2019s plan of using alternative sources of energy for the realization of his plans continued. After much research, he finds out about the story of the Easter Island civilization and their monoliths. As such, Dr. Eggman begins to alter the frequencies of each of the Auric Monoliths using his mechanisms to direct towards his new base of operation - the Egg Bastion - a space station embedded with a giant satellite dish, which, when connected to the Auric Monoliths and fully powered with all of the Chaos Emeralds, will have the ability to brainwash anyone to serve under Dr. Eggman\u2019s command!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-aural"}
