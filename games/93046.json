Pok\u00e9mon Box itself is not so much a game as it is a storage system for Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nTrainers can store up to 1,500 Pok\u00e9mon in twenty-five boxes that hold 60 Pok\u00e9mon each and trade between Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, as well as FireRed and LeafGreen. All of the Pok\u00e9mon can be stored on a GameCube memory card, requiring the full 59 blocks for save data. A special edition Ruby and Sapphire Memory Card 59 is included with most versions of the game for players to use (the European version just comes with a normal memory card)."}
