Farm peacefully, engage in political mind games or lay siege to sworn enemies.\n\nBesiege the castle that\u2019s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction\u2019s war effort, pillage your neighbour\u2019s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! A range of stats, rankings and achievements gives every player something to aim for, from \u2018Banquet King\u2019 and \u2018Peacebringer\u2019 to 'Besieger of the Month' and \u2018Lionheart'! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals all provide a real sense of structured community, with many different ways to chat with other players, discuss strategies and build allegiances.\n\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any lord or lady's domain, you can also specialise with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant, each promotion brings with it valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming, religion and more. Be aware though, as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals and parishioners will look to you for guidance and leadership. You may find yourself fighting for the crown itself!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stronghold-kingdoms", "videos": [{"id": 18205, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ox8v053RdUM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox8v053RdUM", "title": "Stronghold Kingdoms MMO Trailer (English)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox8v053RdUM/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 155, "name": "Stronghold"}, {"id": 5360, "name": "Stronghold: Spin-off"}]}
