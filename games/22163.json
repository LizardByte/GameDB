Help the Titans as used car tyres and soda cans set their villages on fire!\n\nUsing intuitive touch controls you control a tiny firetruck, but since the fires are sometimes hard to reach, you need to use obstacles, buttons and elevators to put them out. Your water supply is limited - earn drops by conserving water!\n\n* Five distinct islands with a total of 60 levels provide hours of challenging entertainment.\n\n* Amazing water physics - The original Sprinkle set a new standard for water in games. Sprinkle Islands improves on that with endless oceans, pools and floating objects.\n\n* Easy controls, challenging gameplay!\n\nThe original Sprinkle game has been enjoyed by more than eight million people. Join the fun in this improved version!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sprinkle-islands"}
