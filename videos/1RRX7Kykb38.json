Collect 4 cubes and you win!!!  The game then loops endlessly each time getting a little harder.\n\nAround the levels there are repair pods where you can repair your autobot or leave them there to use a different autobot.  During play you can transform between robot and vehicle.  In robot mode you can fly around shooting the decepticons. In vehicle mode you can move quickly and drive through any ground based decepticons.  While not really shown here, a good strategy is to have the robots in different pods to you can scroll the screen when selecting them which may reveal an energon cube.  A big issue with the game is that you need to be at the edges of the screen to scroll and that isn't really enough time to see oncoming enemy or platforms so its a good idea to memorise the map.\n\nThe video opens with ocean Loader v1 by Rob Hubbard.  Once in game i play multiple loops in order to show any difficulty increase.  In the Spectrum version the level would actually change colour.  The game does loop endlessly.  In my faulty memory of the game, i seem to think the decepticons steal those cubes and you have to get them from their base although I could not make that happen during the longplay.  Maybe it does it in the Spectrum version ...we will see.\n\n\n00:00:00 Ocean Loader v1\n00:03:22 Gameplay Starts Here -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1RRX7Kykb38/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1RRX7Kykb38/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1RRX7Kykb38/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1RRX7Kykb38/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore 64 Longplay [062] The Transformers (EU)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nThe Transformers, developed by Denton Designs and published by Ocean in 1985\n\nYou control one of five Transformers and your goal is to collect the energon cubes and take them back to base.
