Played in real time on Snes9x 1.55 with re-records used to optimize video length.\n\nAs you may know, the original Parallel Worlds is known for it's insane difficulty (repetitive miniboss battles, tedious puzzles, swordless guardhouse playthrough). Parallel Worlds 2.0 was to feature redesigned dungeons and a new guardhouse, but this was unfortunately abandoned by SePH.\n\nIn 2012, PuzzleDude released Parallel Remodel, a severely dumbed-down fork of the original PW that minimizes backtracking in addition to removing bomb-jumping and repetitive semi-bosses, changes that prove beneficial to players who have given up on the original PW due to it's insane difficulty. He tried to fix what was wrong with the original PW, but ended up going too far. He shuffled items around to account for the new dungeon order, and in the end, the newly overhauled dungeons were way too linear anyway, and the difficulty levels were inconsistent. For instance, Mothula is still the first boss in Nayru's Bay. Farore's Isle and Level 3: Nabooru's Hole remain mostly unchanged. Level 7: Impa's Ways has no enemies whatsoever except for Moldorm. You only have to climb the Parallel Tower once (in the Icy World), and even then, the Optional Puzzle was made mandatory with no collapsing floors.\n\n Guardhouse & Sewers\n Collection \n Pendant 1: Nayru's Bay (Mothula)\n Pendant 2: Din's Catacombs (Moldorm)\n 2nd Collection\n {\"Pendant 3\"}: Farore's Isle (Helmasaur King)\n Tempered Sword \n Hyrule Castle (Draegor)\n Level 4: Darinia's Cavern (Vitreous)\n Level 7: Impa's Ways (Moldorm)\n 3rd Collection\n Level 3: Nabooru's Hole (Helmasaur King)\n Level 6: Sheik's Hideout (Vitreous, Mothula)\n Level 5: Saria's Gardens (Blind)\n Level 1: Rauru's Ruins (Arrghus)\n Level 2: Ruto's Fortress (Kholdstare, Mothula)\n Level 8: Parallel Tower [Icy World]\n Final Collection\n FINAL BOSS: Ganon\n Ending & Credits", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCDQEnbcpho/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCDQEnbcpho/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCDQEnbcpho/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCDQEnbcpho/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCDQEnbcpho/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Remodel v1.1 (ALTTP Hack) Walkthrough", "description": "A complete video walkthrough with a 100% item collection for version 1.1 of The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Remodel.
