The intro starts with a picture sequence of Agumon evolving into Greymon, transitions into a short FMV sequence of Greymon firing a fire ball, then into a slideshow showing seven of the main human characters, and ends with a few screens of text, before showing the title screen and then the main menu. The intro is well done for a bootleg game, with accurate colors on part with what the system can handle (except for Mimi who has pink skin), a two second smooth FMV, and decently translated English text.\n\nThe player starts out playing as Agumon with three extra lives. Agumon can jump, and attack by shooting a fire ball from his mouth. On the first level, Betamon can be found as enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/digimon-2"}
