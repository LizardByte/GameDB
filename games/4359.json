With more road to drive on, rivals to fight, and cars to master, this entry offers everything and more.\n\nIn the game, you race around the streets of Tokyo at night in an almost seamless experience, from cruising around, to joining a race, to cruising again. Flash your headlights when tailing a rival to incite a race, and after a short cinematic, you're both off. To win a race, you need to take down your opponent's power meter, while keeping yours intact. It decreases when hitting objects, and, more importantly, in last place.\n\nThe game is less focused on the realism of a racer, but still takes into account a good amount of customization, from upgrades to tuning. Since you'll be driving the car almost constantly, its best to have your own personal vehicle. The roads you drive on start out limited, but expand as you dive deeper and deeper into the game. Don't expect to go without memorizing the tracks; in order to beat the best, you need to make Tokyo your home.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tokyo-xtreme-racer-2", "videos": [{"id": 74061, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mGqIiLENHzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGqIiLENHzA", "title": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 | SEGA Dreamcast Old Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mGqIiLENHzA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 74062, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Gcnue_b8vCE"}]}
