Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 28709, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7DUCA8wK9Ls", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DUCA8wK9Ls", "title": "Metro: Last Light - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7DUCA8wK9Ls/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 28710, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KEdXiptHlVM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEdXiptHlVM", "title": "Metro: Last Light - Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KEdXiptHlVM/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 4413, "name": "Russian Voice Talent"}, {"id": 4414, "name": "English Voice Talent"}]}
