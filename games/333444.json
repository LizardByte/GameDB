For example, they lack a co-op mode or the free-roam Shire overworld. However, it includes an arena mode not featured in the Wii and PS3 versions, and levels set in Caradhras, at the Gates of Erebor (including a battle with the Watcher in the Water), and in Dunharrow, areas not found in the Wii/PS3 versions. This version is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view, and is more of an action role-playing game, featuring stat-management and experience points to spend on special abilities. The Wii/PS3 version does not feature any kind of stat-management or experience points, save for the abovementioned ability to collect items to improve the attack and defense of characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-aragorns-quest", "videos": [{"id": 141565, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cwYeu1h7CN8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwYeu1h7CN8", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest PS2 Gameplay HD (PCSX2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cwYeu1h7CN8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
