{"id": "4dnw9dWISvw", "snippet": {"title": "Get Even \u2013 \u201cWhat is real (Early concept teaser)\u201d", "description": "facebook.com/GetEvenGame\n\nThis is a video presenting a first concept of Get Even. This has now evolved and you will have a chance to check new video in upcoming days. Get Even is coming out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One in Spring 2017.\n\nCole Black is a man with questions\u2026 Or so he is told. \nWhen he awakes in an old abandoned asylum, his sole memory is the attempted rescue of a teenage girl with a bomb strapped to her chest. Everything else is blank. With a strange technology fused to his head - used to read and replay human memory - Black travels into the depths of his own mind. To find the truth of his past. To find the truth of what happened. And to answer two very simple questions: \u2018Why were you there?\u2019 and, \u2018Who was the girl?\u2019\n\nTo create the photo-realistic visuals that bring the gritty universe to life, Get Even is the first game to use large-scale, real-world scanning to create expansive and lifelike environments. This 3D scanning technology combines with advanced lighting effects to create a stunning and believable world that pushes the boundaries of the genre.\n\nThis teaser contains few live-action shots. It was meant to show how reality can mix with in-game elements. All locations are actual part of the game in the exact form shown in teaser. . \n\nMusic by: Pawe\u0142 Cincio", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dnw9dWISvw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dnw9dWISvw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dnw9dWISvw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dnw9dWISvw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4dnw9dWISvw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Get Even \u2013 \u201cWhat is real (Early concept teaser)\u201d", "description": "facebook.com/GetEvenGame\n\nThis is a video presenting a first concept of Get Even.
