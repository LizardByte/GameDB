The story is strange when compared to other Tom Clancy endorsed media, as corrupt members of the Russian Kremlin are intent on causing earthquakes with a new form of Weapon of Mass Destruction. Unlike other titles in the series, the events seem to only take place in one location rather than multiple sites from around the globe. This is likely due to storage limits, as it was a mobile phone game for flip-phones and brick-phones.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
