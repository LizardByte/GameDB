All sorts of adventurers are drawn to the dungeons beneath the temple, hoping to get rich beyond anyones imagination.\n\nBrian Hammerhand, however, had different reasons to return to Apshai. Each night at full moon since he has left a year ago, he has the same dream over and over again. He returned to tell his old friend the wizard Merlis about that dream and to seek counsel.\n\nIn the dream, Brian Hammerhand staggers through some kind of fiery, hellish dungeon. He fights a huge winged demon and after conquering it, he discovers a woman sleeping on some kind of altar, surrounded by rings of flames. After picking her up to rescue her, he is followed by some hooded bony figure who seems to be Death himself. The figures grabs his arm and Brian Hammerhand wakes up.\n\nAfter showing Merlis the mark on his arm where the hooded figure touched him in his dream, the wizard explains that the woman Brian has seen in his dream is Brynhild, a warrior queen, who has vanished three hundred years ago.\n\nIt seems, that Brynhild is held in a magic prison somwhere beneath the stil mostly buried Temple of Apshai. And although Brian Hammerhand thought he had explored every nook and cranny thouroughly, it seems there are still some mysteries to be unraveld. Why, even on his way to Merlis he heard about a fifth level which was discovered only weeks before. And didn't he meet Shalimar, a fierce fighter who could be mistaken for a amazon, claiming she barely escaped from a labyrinth unbeknowest to anyone until now?\n\nAlthough Brian Hammerhand does not want to venture down into the dangerous dungeons of Apshai again, if he ever wants to find peace and those terrible dreams to stop, he has no choice but to try and rescue Brynhild...", "summary": "Sequel to \"Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai\".
