Enter Webfoot Productions and Hello Kitty: Happy Party Pals for the GBA! My youngest sister owns a physical copy of this game, and getting the ROM for this made me learn... Never use CoolROMs again... Anyway, this game tasks you to throw ever grander parties to meet increasingly stricter goals, along with a bunch of mini-games to play. This video only shows the first level, the dead air is from how I get things to fade out to black in Movie Maker... Also, sorry about the audio lag durring the Kitty Cakes mini-game, this was my first time using Visual Boy, also, the pancakes are so hard to tell when they turn pink on my PC monitor, dang it all!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dxpilABeS9k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dxpilABeS9k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dxpilABeS9k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Hello Kitty Happy Party Pals", "description": "Well, my birthday's on Wednesday, so how do I celebrate it here?
