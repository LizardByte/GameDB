This new hack randomizes enemies and bosses to create a new experience for long-time fans.\n\nFor more information and to download, visit the Github page:\nhttps://github.com/Minty-Meeo/Pikmin-1-Randomizer-Gecko\n\nWant to learn more about Pikmin hacking?

Pikmin Randomizer started as an experiment using Gecko codes.  By the end, I had pushed Gecko codes to their limits, quite literally, as there was very little memory left in the Gecko codehandler.  After the v2 release, I was actually in the process of porting the hack to C-Kit and doing some decompilation work on relevant generator code, but became distracted by improving C-Kit itself, then other projects grabbed my attention, and eventually I lost most motivation to get anything done with hacking.  I still think about the lost potential all the time.  I still tell myself I will return to it some day.  Maybe I will, who knows.  So basically, I'm sorry I fell off and failed to deliver a better randomizer.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6UHLN_9ntA4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6UHLN_9ntA4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6UHLN_9ntA4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6UHLN_9ntA4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Pikmin 1 Randomizer [Trailer]", "description": "Join Captain Olimar and the Pikmin in a new take on the first Pikmin adventure!
