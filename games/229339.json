All characters have received a boost to their running speed and climb even higher after picking up a Super Bell, making platforming that little bit snappier. You can now also use gyro controls for certain sections of the game that previously required touch controls.\n\nAs well as same system and local wireless co-op play with up to four people, you can now play Super Mario 3D World together online for the very first time!
