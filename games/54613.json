Exploration is about intentionally getting lost and the joy of being found again. Your presence is the driving force behind the evolving environment as you establish permanent monuments to mark your way. Without your presence, will the forest still come alive?\n\nShape of the World builds on the ideas of experiential games like Proteus and Flower where points and combat don\u2019t enter the equation. An evolving world that grows with each step and hints at distant landmarks encourages the player to explore. Shape of the World offers a unique unfolding experience for those seeking an alternative to quest-driven adventure games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shape-of-the-world", "videos": [{"id": 15296, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dDn9cZ4jjiA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDn9cZ4jjiA", "title": "Shape of the World - Teaser trailer: A first person exploration game.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dDn9cZ4jjiA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
