Game satirises the Aum Shinrikyo cult and the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack orchestrated by the cult. A common misconception is that the game was produced by the cult as propaganda, whereas Kamikuishiki-mura Monogatari actually portrays Aum and the sarin gas attack negatively, mocking its members and showing footage of 'humiliating' media coverage.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kamikuishiki-mura-monogatari"}
