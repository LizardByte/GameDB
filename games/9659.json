One day, an accident occurs that floods the men's dormitory, which leaves Riki with no place to stay. Luckily, Kud is willing to lend a hand, and she's also looking for a roommate.\n\nA spin-off of Little Busters! that focuses on Noumi Kudryavka and Riki Naoe's after story.", "summary": "Kud Wafter is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Riki Naoe. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Kud Wafter follows a branching plot line with multiple endings; depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to bring the plot in an alternate direction.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kud-wafter", "videos": [{"id": 3833, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "UmZpzZrT6jU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmZpzZrT6jU", "title": "Kud Wafter Op", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmZpzZrT6jU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
