It's again a game that can be played by two players though a single player game is also a possibility. If played by two players they can cooperate by docking the jets together, docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-laydock-mission-striker-network-version"}
