The terrorists make impossible demands and threaten to detonate a miniature nuclear weapon if the demands are not met.\n\nThe protagonist, initially armed with only a knife, decides to rescue both individuals. Along the way, he collects other weapons and evidence to convince other police officers to let him continue his work, as he heads to an army base, a booby-trapped airplane, and finally central park, where the terrorists make the last stand.", "summary": "The gameplay could be compared with the Last Ninja series. It has an isometric view and is flick screen. You can pick up useful items like weapons (knives, and guns), which blink when you enter a screen containing such an item, as well as the evidence needed to complete each stage. Any collected evidence is shown on a camera film reel.\n\nOnce all the evidence is collected on a stage then the game changes to a driving game where you have to get to the next stage. The car is viewed from behind and you must avoid the other vehicles as well as helicopters dropping bombs but your car is armed with a cannon and missiles. Police cars have to be avoided or they will ask to see any evidence you have.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vendetta", "videos": [{"id": 34632, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kVH97OSW3ho", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVH97OSW3ho", "title": "C64 Longplay - Vendetta  Part 1/2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kVH97OSW3ho/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
