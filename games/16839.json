The Hermes reached the planet first in order to establish a presence in anticipation of the arrival of the Hephaestus.", "summary": "Signs of Life is a sci-fi survival sandbox platformer with a combination of procedurally generated and hand-crafted content. You'll explore mysterious locations, Mine blocks for resources, and meet strange (and some familiar) creatures, some of which don't even want to kill you and eat your corpse. Along the way, you'll be able to craft armor, weapons, gadgets and more to assist you in surviving in an inhospitable environment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/signs-of-life"}
