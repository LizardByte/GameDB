The episode consists of 7 levels of varying themes and difficulty. The first Vae Victus was an attempt to honor the traditional gameplay of Alien Vendetta and other classic megawads; however, VV2 is a more balanced approach that provides challenging battles without the swarms of roaming enemies. The architecture is improved over last year's offering, and is more refined in it's concept and design. I am a classic doomer at heart, so I decided to keep this wad compatible with every source port that allows for limit removing. Co-op play is also supported, as are difficulty settings. In addition, every map can be beat from pistol starts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vae-victus-2"}
