To introduce a new player in the game world, he must create a character, give him a ASPECT (sex, constitution, hairstyle, clothing ...), select a crime for which he has been imprisoned and some defining features.\n\nTo improve the character and increase the level he need to get experience. This is obtained from fights, but also helping many of the Bots doing several missions. He can fight in groups to share the experience of a difficult fight, although a senior level, players are often organized in clans to communicate better and help, establish a uniform etc.\n\nThe character has a set of skills depending on the chosen crime. Some of them require that the character and his training have reached a certain level of experience. He can also try to steal items from action bots. When caught, a fight can be started, but also at any given moment with another character.\n\nAs in other games, there are several trade skills, here for instance by going to the kitchen and combining objects in the oven, or finding books in libraries to learn recipes, concepts of mechanics, the art of chemical or sewing. The game has an advanced and configurable chat system to improve the communications between players.\n\nThe point of view in the game is third-person. The character can also be seen from different fixed cameras, depending of the room where he is in. When in combat, the player enters a special \"combat mode\" where he can control the cameras of the scene. Up to 32 players can be immersed in a battle between prisoners or bots.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/la-prision"}
