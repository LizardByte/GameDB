There he awaited the arrival of Roach, an eight legged man-like creature with a crooked nose and an eyeless pink face. That moment never came. Startled, again, he leaped over the mounds and met his maker, a man who had once been a king and whose rule was unquestioned.\n\nThe world fell silent after he became a god. Even after his ascension, Mongol refused to serve. Mongol would serve no one. In his mind, the old world had still remained alive. Countless attempts at his life failed. And the perpetrators were punished with a fate much worse than death. With each breath their lungs grew in size, until they became as fat as Zeppelins.\n\nTheir ribs were shattered. Inhaling the poisonous and colorless gas that surrounded them made them grow infected stingers. Purple patches appeared on their fingers. They were paralyzed with fear as their bodies contorted into bridges. The weaker ones fell, while the strongest survived. The great god Agrippa had seen them rise and drop bombs upon his lands. But, instead of exploding, they released weird appendages that squirmed.", "summary": "Enter the realm of Agrippa, where ancient gods and nightmare-inducing creatures rule supreme! This action-adventure game blends psychological horror with an intense story, which challenges players to survive in a reality distorted by malevolent forces.\n\nIn a realm where the line between reality and madness blurs, the face of the ancient god Agrippa lies atop a mountain, commanding legions of grotesque and contorted creatures. Once an artificial humanoid, now wields god-like powers and harbors a deep resentment towards his creators.\n\nAgrippa's torment is relentless; he creates an alternate reality where every living being is a twisted reflection of Mongol, designed to break his spirit and mind.\nYou are the shadow of Agrippa, tasked with finding a suitable replacement for Mongol now that he is no longer of any use to him!", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mongol-corpses-of-the-divine", "videos": [{"id": 113782, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "fHGcGdUAKPs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHGcGdUAKPs", "title": "Mongol - Corpses of the divine - gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fHGcGdUAKPs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113838, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "QSNqWjQ2mHY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSNqWjQ2mHY", "title": "Mongol intro cutscene", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QSNqWjQ2mHY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113839, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MB0so9Fib_Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB0so9Fib_Q", "title": "Mongol - second cutscene", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MB0so9Fib_Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113900, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "W_ttnrY68CA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ttnrY68CA", "title": "Mongol - corpses of the divine official trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_ttnrY68CA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
