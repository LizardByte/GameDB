Life finally seems like it's looking up for Chungus as he transfers to Gekkoukan High School, and even receives a personal invitation to stay at the Iwatodai Dorm. He even makes some interesting new friends who are eager to pretend like they don't know him!\n\nHowever, after an unfortunate incident involving a large blob monster and a gun, Chungus learns that he's had a hidden talent all along: calling forth a vuvuzela-wielding Persona by the name of Orpheus by shooting himself in the head! After this little stunt, Chungus accidentally ends up leading the group known as SEES in their battles against the entities known as Shadows as they fight to find a way to end the Dark Hour with a reasonably low body count.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/persono-0", "videos": [{"id": 91743, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D5NP_pyWKL0"}]}
