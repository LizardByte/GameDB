It sits on the edge of Ladeona Mountains, overlooking the great river Arno in the north of Narr. Helpless in the relentless grip of an invisible force, a mysterious darkness that has spread from the ancient battlefield of Ashglades; warping and poisoning every creature in it's path, creating bloodthirsty monsters.\nTrouble began when miners and traders began to disappear and rumours of massacres began to circulate. Mistrust and terror fanned conflicts among the people who live in fear of the elves from the nearby region. The managers of the mines, known as the North Trade Guild, appealed to the king, and the once powerful Kordelis family that govern the region, for help. The king sends a unit to uncover the mystery surrounding the icy peaks of the Northern Highlands, under the experienced leadership of Sir Herken Salavon, your foster father.\nYou are one of the soldiers in the unit and insufficiently trained. The situation required immediate action. Waiting for you to complete your training was not an option. Concerned for your safety, your foster father leaves you behind in Korden's fall and embarked on the quest with the rest of the men. He tells you as he always did, that people, not demons were behind the big evil.\nEvents take you from Korden's Fall, through old, abandoned forts, dungeons once inhabited by dwarves and ancient tombs. You go from the elven city Recea, to the Great Northern Swamps, and the magical city of Sidis Tarea inhabited by the Danians, a mystical race. You reveal the ancient scripts that tell the legends of dwarves, exterminated in the centuries-old war with humans, and stumble unto the greatest of them all, the legend of Dawn. But most of its parts have been dismantled by great sages and hidden across the continent of Narr. The one who finds all the parts and reassemble them will restore its power, the only power that can dispel the dark forces over Ashglades. Returning Dawn to Ashglades will finally bring light to the endless darkness.", "summary": "Fresh out of the lair of Dreamatrix Game Studios, Legends of Dawn invites players to the brutal northerly reaches of Narr. Survival depends on you, your magic and your sword.\nWhat sets Legends of Dawn apart, is the freedom of play expressed in several key attributes that are rarely seen in typical RPG genres. We have poured our passion and creativity into taking you on an enthralling ride away from wearisome reality, by providing you with the choice to be whatever your heart desires, in Legends of Dawn.\n\nOf course, the choices you make during game play does not prevent you from trying something else later, or simultaneously if you wish. You could combine the sword and the magic, be a powerful crafter or anything else. Legends of Dawn liberates from class restrictions unlike real life. Class, race and differences exist within the game but after choosing your own race and gender, all else can be altered without restarting the game.\n\nAnother quality that makes Legends of Dawn interesting, is the freedom of direction and movement. Most games force a player to follow the main storyline and forbid any deviation, or significant veering off the set course. Legends of Dawn is more sympathetic to your playing needs. You are free to wander wherever tickles your fancy within the continent, without limitations, under one condition. Stay alive. We have been careful to ensure that the quests only suggest, rather than impose direction of movement. Your journey is in your hands alone.\n\nIn addition to all those remarkable features already mentioned, you are bound to notice another cool thing about Legends of Dawn. The absence of loading screen. It would have been so much easier to create a game that would constantly force you to wait before the screen while new contents load, but Dreamatrix is aware that your time is too valuable to waste. We put our heads together and created our very own engine that discreetly streams content in the background, in real time. You are free to enter houses, caves, dungeons, temples, new regions and so much more, without those pesky loading screens interrupting your playing pleasure.\n\nIn order to provide you with such blissful range of possibilities, we had to create a rather large world called Narr. The world of Narr in Legends of Dawn, spans across continents through stunning picturesque landscape that stimulates the mind. There are magical regions where the mountains and hills defy gravity, buoyant as balloons. We have also created countless dungeons awaiting for you to discover what mysteries lie within their cold depths, as well as camps, impressive docks and grim fortresses that bear silent witness to battles. Mausoleums and cemeteries also await your exploration. The hikes over unforgiving mountains and canyons are sure to thrill the most ardent explorer. Graceful flying islands and mystical swamps instil a sense of awe that could nudge you to cross the threshold of the serene temples and shrines to pay your respects to the gods of the land. With so much more on offer than is mentioned here, there is no reason why Legends of Dawn should not become your favourite RPG.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legends-of-dawn"}
