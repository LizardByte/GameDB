The initial idea was: How do I make a game with only one turn interesting? Give it lots of endings--in fact there are many 'endings' and (hopefully) every sensible action results in an 'ending'. There is no winning action. There is however more going on than just this and the more endings you see the more things should become clear.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aisle"}
