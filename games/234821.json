Legend has it that they lived in a strange equilibrium of fierce peace and harmony, in unbreakable bonds with the elder races.\n\nThen, something horrible happened. But all memory is lost. The Dragons disappeared, banished from memory, turned into myth. Only fragments and trails of clues to their history exist across the continents, for those who look.\n\nNow, strange orbs have appeared. Are these the Dragon eggs of old, lost in Time and only reappearing now? Or are they the sign of the Dragons just being in hiding, biding their time to re-emerge? Clues lie riddled across the lands, beneath the mountains, in the seas and skies; remnants, lost memories of the elders. The one who finds the answers to what happened with the Dragons, will become alI-powerful and able to harness and wield the full power of Time.\n\nNow is the time of re-birth to bring the mighty Dragons back! Whomever the re-incarnated Dragons latch on to at their hatching ceremony, will forever form an unbreakable bond with them. A bond only severable through the most powerful of magic.\n\nThis is the Time of Genesis. The birth of a new Dragon age has come!", "summary": "Eternal Dragons is the next step in gaming.
