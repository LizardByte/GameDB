This process combines Oblivion\u2019s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll\u2019s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion.\n\nSkyblivion will feature the remastered entirety of Oblivion\u2019s mainland, Cyrodiil, from the wintery slopes of the Valus and Jerall Mountains to the swamps of Blackwood and warm-beachy shores of the Gold Coast. Skyblivion will bring the return of many classic Oblivion mechanics like spell crafting, a complete class and attributes system, underwater combat, and NPC disposition.\n\nIn addition to recreating Oblivion\u2019s systems and porting them into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\u2019s engine the project has taken great care in providing new improvements and additions. Skyblivion offers fans remastered graphics, weather, and lighting, an expanded soundtrack, new gameplay mechanics, and even a limited selection of bespoke minor quests with original voice acting to further flesh out barren areas of Oblivion\u2014all for free!\n\nOnce Skyblivion is released in 2025, fans will have access to the entirety of Oblivion\u2019s pre-DLC world space, systems, and quests available for play. But that\u2019s not the end of the project! Following a period of bug-fixing and community-supported updates the project development team will move on to working on Oblivion\u2019s nine additional content releases plus the Shivering Isles expansion.\n\nWith Skyblivion you experience the best of both worlds: The complex and detailed RPG experience of Oblivion paired with Skyrim\u2019s newer systems, graphics, and quality of life improvements.
