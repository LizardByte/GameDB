You will step in the shoes of Theodore Thompson, a retired man with an emotional history. His Grandfather used to be a Forest Ranger in the Yosemite Valley. A beautiful wilderness heavily inspired by the real world location in Yosemite National Park, USA.\nThis beautiful location needs a new Forest Ranger and you, as Theodore, need a break from the life you had and will return to Yosemite Valley where you spent all your summers as a young kid learning outdoor skills from your grandfather.\nBut why has it been so long since you last came here? What makes this beautiful place a place with beautiful memories and on the flipside such heavy and dark emotions..?\nWill you be able to fill those footsteps your Grandfather left empty? Will you find the answers you're looking for? Will you have what it takes to become the next Yosemite Forest Ranger?\n\nDuring Yosemite Forest Ranger you will get to know Theodore and learn what happened in his very emotional and heartbreaking past.
