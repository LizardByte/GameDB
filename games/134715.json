A small group of scientists are secretly investigating it when a mysterious woman appears, facing an impossible task. \n \nStars Die is a non-linear, sci-fi mystery game with branching dialogues. \n \nFEATURES \n \n- Completely non-linear story. Have long debates with people or ignore them the entire game. \n- Five parallel, but interconnected story lines, each with its own completely separate ending. \n- The player isn't at the center of the narrative. Each character has their own agenda and they will try to act accordingly in real time, with or without you. \n- You can take your time to explore the environments freely, but you might miss events and conversations if you take too long. \n- The choices aren't about moral dilemmas, but ideological ones. It's all about your personal perspective on the events and what you believe in. \n- Dark industrial soundtrack by composer Connor ORT Linning.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 37101, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "iuyITSnLDgk"}]}
