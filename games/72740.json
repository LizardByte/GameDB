The background story is that Ares challenged Zeus for control over the Olympus and now they use eleven heroes and monsters (e.g. Odysseus or Polyphemus) to battle it out in area fights.\n\nThe player takes control over one of those fighters, selects one of the four difficulty levels and has to win eight rounds against randomly chosen enemies. This is also the only single-player mode (of course there is also the possibility to fight against another player) and every victory rewards credits. Those can be used to unlock more characters, character biographies and concept art. Regarding gameplay, each fighter has three basic moves (can be combined for combo attacks), special moves ( performed by pressing the correct button combination) and an especially powerful, unblockable divine power, e.g. Perseus can summon Zeus.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mythic-blades", "videos": [{"id": 140394, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Tg6dbv6-1W4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg6dbv6-1W4", "title": "Mythic Blades", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tg6dbv6-1W4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
