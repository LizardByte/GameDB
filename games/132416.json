Where everyone wants to kill Pandora, she wants to kill someone else. She wants to kill the traitor. It's a meticulous plan, all leading to these six deadly hours. It would be funny if it wasn't so morbid.\n\nShould the allotted time expire, then...\nPandora is the mastermind. This isn't about finding her; this is about finding the traitor.

Welcome to My Emptiness.\n\nYou will all surrender your right to live.", "summary": "You are Pandora, the mastermind behind a death game in which you must find the traitor while concealing your identity.
