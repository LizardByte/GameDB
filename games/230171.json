It is a single-player Medal Game with many themes from Super Mario Bros. 3, especially the Super Mario Advance 4 version.\n\nPlayers load their medals so they can shoot them into the machine from the right or left. After that, players use the buttons to fire the coins out on to the field. As they fall down, they fall in one of many pockets that activate points in the game. Mario usually moves around automatically, though each time a coin goes into one of the side pockets, Mario will jump either small or big. Players can trigger many events by getting Mario to jump at the right time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-fushigi-no-janjanland"}
