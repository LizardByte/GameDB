An evil witch resides there and she seems to have come out of nightmares in fairy tales. It is said she was searching for immortality, but she has not stepped out of the tower since eons ago. People have been disappearing and nobody knows exactly why. All they know is the witch did it.\n\nKahoro learns of this tale from their grandparents and believes the witch may have a cure for their peculiar illness. They run away from their home and enter the tower with the hope their nightmare will finally end.\n\nBut instead, a new dream begins. Kahoro meets Tetra, a doll and the ex-servant of the witch of the tower.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kahoro-and-tetra"}
