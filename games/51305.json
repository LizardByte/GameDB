The game has an audio-visual style similar to Game Boy Advance games. Rather than an action-adventure game like the Zelda series, Legend of Princess follows an action-platformer gameplay model. All of Bind's moves and items are derived from Link's abilities in the Zelda games. Throughout the dungeon, the player can break pots for jewels, and discover hidden treasure chests with stockpiles of jewels and/or hearts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
