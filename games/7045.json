Players play as Space Marines attempting to halt an Ork invasion spaceship, facing orks and later, Tyranids on board. Four Space Marine classes are playable including ranged specialists like the Sternguard Veteran and Techmarine, and more melee focused classes like the Vanguard Veteran and Librarian. The game supports single player and same screen multiplayer modes.\n\nThe game received average and favourable reviews on both platforms, being described as generally enjoyable or fun, but let down by a short campaign, lack of online multiplayer, and a limited appeal to non Warhammer:40,000 fans.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warhammer-40-000-kill-team", "videos": [{"id": 2514, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "W9n4aGILHos", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9n4aGILHos", "title": "Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W9n4aGILHos/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
