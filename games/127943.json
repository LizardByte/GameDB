You're able to choose one of three classes, then join the fight against most dangerous monsters which are hunting you. Every class has its own abilities and traits. You can become a killing machine or a strong support for your teammates. In game you can get different items with magic powers: helmets, armor and trinkets. As you kill monsters you will get experience points and level ups. Difficulty of the game grows exponentially as you progress, don't forget to upgrade your stats. There are checkpoints every 10 waves, so you won't lose your character and loot.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/base-defense", "videos": [{"id": 32682, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Sp3AdnxwJ7s"}]}
