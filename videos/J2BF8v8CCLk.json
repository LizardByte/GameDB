Anime R's work is mostly buried in Sunrise robot shows from the 80s that don't get much play from fans anymore, so they've never received their due respect over here (though the same could be said for many great subcontractors of yore). This pilot offers a dense summation of what made Anime R great, so it's the perfect introduction to this studio.\n\nSource: http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/pony-metal-u-gaim", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J2BF8v8CCLk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J2BF8v8CCLk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J2BF8v8CCLk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pony Metal U-GAIM Promotion Film", "description": "Pony Metal U-GAIM is an anime that was never made.
