It does not use many of the new features such as the hold function and the four block preview. Players are also not allowed to change the keyboard controls, which they can in every other mode. The goal is to score as many points as possible. The speed increases after a certain number of lines are cleared. This is similar to other standard Tetris modes available in other games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris-n-blox"}
