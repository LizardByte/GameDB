This game has several significant changes from the traditional format. The first, and most noticeable, change is that the board is viewed in an isometric, 3D format. Because of this, it can sometimes be difficult to remember where the ghosts or the remaining pellets are. Secondly, and more importantly, Pac-Man can now jump. This in principle makes evading ghosts easier.\n\nNES Relatives:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45j9a6_FiyM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHOLR0bdBXc\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est Jan 2007.
