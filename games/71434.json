It offers improved graphics, more modes of play, various art galleries and a costume system, allowing you to wear Golden Axe attire.\n\nSimilar to the Sega Saturn version players can earn extra lives through a minigame, though rather than being a port of Deep Scan, it is a simulation of the 1968 electro-mechanical machine Periscope.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
