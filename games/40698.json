The character is a humble construction worker who must pick up crates to use as platforms to get Mary to climb up, eventually leading to the top of the valley. The villain of the story is a mustachioed fiend who keeps Mary at the bottom of the valley for his own perverse pleasure.\n\nThe player controls a crane at the top of the valley that moves picks up crates when the button is pressed. Bonus items can be picked up for extra points. The level can be restarted in the following ways:\n\n- The water reaches above Mary's head\n- A crate is knocked into/dropped on Mary\n- Mary is dropped from a high place.\n\nThere is no definite ending, since once all the levels are completed, the game starts over. Therefore, the game loops on into eternity. Save Mary was in production for over 2 years, longer than any other Atari 2600 game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/save-mary"}
