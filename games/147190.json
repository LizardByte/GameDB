Use your third arm to perform targeted attacks and throws, manipulate the environment, destroy obstacles, and wreck enemies.\n\nHunt criminals across the fringes of the galaxy, the core worlds, and the ruins of long-gone civilizations. Upgrade your equipment, gain new abilities, grow stronger and destroy anything that stands in your way.\n\nEnjoy a complex story interwoven with high-octane gameplay and full of twists and turns that hit as hard as a bounty hunter's third arm!", "summary": "Become Aidan, a three-armed mutant who hunts the most dangerous bounties in the galaxy.
