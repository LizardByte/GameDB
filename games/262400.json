In comparison to its predecessor, the game features less, but more involved sections:\n\nWinston and the Great Water Cycle Story: This is a linear novel which tells the story of Winston, the water molecule. Within the text are multiple icons which lead to supplemental scientific information, animations and videos.\n\nOslo's Coloring Book:A drawing program which can be used for own creations or coloring included pictures.\n\nOslo's WaterWorks BoardGame: A virtual board game. First the player chooses the aggregate phase of the playing stone which means either 0, 1 or 2 advances on the board. The second step is clicking the spinning button which gives two randomly generated numbers: one of them can be chosen and the number is added to the number of moves which are executed afterwards. Depending on the field the player lands on, special effects may take place: receiving clams or having the aggregate phase locked for the next move. The goal is to collect as many clamps before the first player reaches the end of the road.\n\nIn addition there are a few short animations which can be triggered in the main menu.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adventures-with-oslo-world-of-water"}
