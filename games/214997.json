You have to play though the frozen North Pole of the Mushroom Kingdom to save them!\n\nTCA is a hack featuring level changes, animation, and a bunch of assembly hacks to change the game into something new. This hack has the same level of difficulty as the original Super Mario Bros, and I do hope you can enjoy it without savestates.\n\nThere is a catch however, since it is only a short game (4 levels) you only start off with one life. However, there are lives scattered though all 4 levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toads-christmas-adventure"}
