This is a non-profitable project and I do not own any assets provided from Infinity Ward.\n\nIt has been more than FOUR years of development. Believe it or not, I initially started making this campaign more than four years ago by myself. It was planned to be one single medium sized map, but due to bad planning or no planning at all, I was putting more ideas into it and grew it larger and larger, and I had to learn and do it all. Taking into consideration other real life delays like school, exams, vacations etc, this takes us up to 4 years of development.\n\nI am so glad I made it this far, and that the Main Release of \"Rooftops\" Campaign is finally out for public. I hope you all enjoy it and have a great time.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5UscymxSPY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5UscymxSPY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5UscymxSPY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5UscymxSPY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5UscymxSPY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Call of Duty 4: \"Rooftops\" Launch Trailer & Main Release!", "description": "Finally, the Main Release of Call of Duty 4: \"Rooftops\" Campaign is out and available for public!
