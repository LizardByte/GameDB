The scent of despair hung thickly in the air, all hope of survival having been quashed.\n\nBut then, from out of the darkness of the mourning clouds came a single bright light in the sky.\n\n\"Silverhawk.........\"\n\nLike a phoenix brought forth from the embers of a burning world, the bird shaped visage became a beacon of the planet's last fight for survival! Perhaps the end is not as nigh as it first appeared.", "summary": "Darius Alpha is a promotional version of Darius Plus released in 1990 for the PC Engine. It was a mail-order exclusive, obtainable by sending in a pair of coupons found in the manuals of Super Darius and Darius Plus. There were only 800 copies of the card produced, making it one of the rarest, and the absolute most expensive, PC Engine HuCard ever made. This version is only a Boss Rush, where the player faces against all Plus bosses one after another.\n\nLike Plus, Alpha features SuperGrafx support, which greatly reduces sprite flickering.\n\nPressing Select on the title screen starts the game with a 4-minute time limit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darius-alpha", "videos": [{"id": 39912, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eM6QMvmNeUs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM6QMvmNeUs", "title": "PC Engine Longplay [113] Darius Alpha", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eM6QMvmNeUs/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2083, "name": "Darius"}]}
