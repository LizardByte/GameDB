The remaining witchers embark on a search for their stolen property and a quest for revenge, spreading out to the four corners of the world. Geralt of Rivia ventures south, to the kingdom of Temeria...", "summary": "Based on the novels by a popular Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher is an action-oriented, epic fantasy RPG that takes players on a journey through a world which in many ways mirrors our own. Take on the role of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster hunter, as he embarks on a quest of self-discovery and revenge.\n\nThe game's time-delayed decision-consequence system ensures that the consequences of your choices will become apparent only in the following chapters of Geralt's story, discouraging returns to a previous save point.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition includes technical and gameplay improvements that bring shorter loading times, more natural animations, and improved inventory, among others. Two new adventures titled The Price of Neutrality and Side Effects will extend players' enjoyment of the game. Finally, the \"D'jinni Adventure Editor\" enables players to create their adventures and shared them with others.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-witcher-enhanced-edition", "videos": [{"id": 36660, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YRD862xzTmk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRD862xzTmk", "title": "The Witcher EE: New inventory and interface", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YRD862xzTmk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9365, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LMStRRVPt6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMStRRVPt6g", "title": "The Witcher - Cinematic Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LMStRRVPt6g/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36657, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "m3EF-71dodo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3EF-71dodo", "title": "The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m3EF-71dodo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36658, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p9uhL8MwTQs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9uhL8MwTQs", "title": "The Witcher EE: Character differentiation and new models", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p9uhL8MwTQs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36659, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vMgX5QNjQOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMgX5QNjQOA", "title": "The Witcher EE: New gestures and dialogue lines", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vMgX5QNjQOA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
