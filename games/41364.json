It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game.\n\nIrem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mahjong-kazoku"}
