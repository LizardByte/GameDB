Originally I wanted to make a complete hack with 120 stars but I just finished 101, though there still are the vanilla vanish cap and vanilla metal cap stages, which means I only made 99 completly new stars. There are still a lot of things I wished I could've changed before uploading this hack, but I am not able to use the tools to change those things anymore. They're just too old...\nI still hope you like this traditional hack and have fun with it!\n--------------------------------------------------\n#SM64 #Hacks #Release", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZ-TWXEEIoI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZ-TWXEEIoI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZ-TWXEEIoI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZ-TWXEEIoI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZ-TWXEEIoI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nice Mario 75 | Release Trailer + Download", "description": "Download with ROMHACKING.com:\nhttps://romhacking.com/hack/nice-mario-75\n\nIf you need a patcher in any sorta way use this patcher by Kaze to patch your own SM64 Rom:\nhttps://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nMusic by DJMykah:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbYE9RDPOIE\n--------------------------------------------------\nInfo:\nIt took me more than 3 years of work, to get this hack to where it is today.\nSadly I abandoned this project about 3-4 years ago.
