Waller sends the squad to \"Fear World\", a world where Earth made its last stand against Brainiac in Gotham City. Here, Lawless tasks the squad with disabling Brainiac's armada so she can extract Green Lantern from his pod. They succeed, though Lawless remains stuck on Brainiac's Skull Ship, forcing the squad to return later to extract her. The squad faces the sixth Brainiac, who uses a combination of Green Lantern and Superman\u2019s powers, and defeats him. Upon returning to the Hall of Justice in Earth-1, Lawless willingly signs up to join Task Force X, in spite of Deadshot's protests. The squad continues their fight on Fear World, and eventually defeats the seventh Brainiac.", "summary": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League \u2013 Season of Lawless launched on October 1, 2024, adding Zoe Lawton (Lawless) as a playable character, a Gotham-themed Elseworld location, new missions, Infamy gear sets, and a Battle Pass.
