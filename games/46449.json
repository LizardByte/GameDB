The \"miracle-people\" discover the price they have to pay soon: a few months after the miracle, their bodies are emptied of all traces of humanity. The new religious order followers will be transformed into beings with no rationality or control, hungry for human flesh and incapable of feeling.\n\nAdam and Eve love each other terribly. They have very different ideas about the Messiah. Adam suspects him to be an impostor and the source of all the evil on Earth. Eve believes exactly the opposite. When Eve decides to follow the Messiah, Adam does not accept his beloved's choice and decides to find her.\n\nA real estate agent, with a past in the marines, helps Adam to find Eve in a city devastated by demons and infernal creatures.\nAnd the story continues...\nWhat will happen when the other seals are broken?", "summary": "Evil Seal is an action horror game inspired by the Apocalypse of St. John.
