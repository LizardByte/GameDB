Play with an anatomically-correct skeleton as part of the Science and Medicine major, or broadcast a radio show with the Communications major.

But your Sim will have to work hard to rise to the top. The surrounding town has a wealth of options for exploration and entertainment. Down java at Roasted Toasted Beans or argue superheroes at Keith\u2019s Komics. Anything to avoid studying.\n\nWhen you want the best for your Sims, it\u2019s time to send them to college.
