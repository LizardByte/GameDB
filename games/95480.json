It uses the same engine as LucasArts' previous title Star Wars: Jedi Knight. The creators aimed to create a game that would be both appealing and nonviolent. The game's original release date was moved up by months, which resulted in the development team cutting some planned game features.\n\nThe game's plot involves the player saving the galaxy by manufacturing droids with specific abilities, such as the ability to see in the dark or jump, to complete missions. The educational portions of these missions teach players about concepts such as energy, force, motion, simple machines, light, and magnetism.\n\nStar Wars: DroidWorks received high praise from critics, sold well, and won numerous awards and accolades.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-droidworks"}
