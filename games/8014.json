After choosing among any of the seven levels in the beginning of the game, you'll watch a short cartoon of The Thornberrys' describing the level's plot. Players can use Eliza's special ability to talk with animals to discover clues and receive special power-ups, while Darwin, Donny, Marianne and Debbie climb mountains, open secret passageways, swing on vines, and talk to the animals.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-wild-thornberrys-animal-adventures", "collections": [{"id": 3138, "name": "Nickelodeon"}]}
