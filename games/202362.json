In many aspects, it is very reminiscent of well-known farming games like Harvest Moon.\n\nIn Reap and Sow you take care of a farm during the day. You start with almost nothing except a few seeds, and from there you must expand with more plants and even livestock. You raise crops, care for animals and befriend the locals in town.\n\nThere is also another part to this game that is vastly different from the farming. That is, what happens during night time. You explore your dream world. The dream world will be a huge world with everything from factories with robots to magic forests with faeries and everything in between.\n\nThe dream world will eventually tie into the real world and you can use some crops that you grow in your farm to affect the dream world (mostly the mushrooms you can grow later). Some items from the real world can also be used in the dream world. The dream world and its inhabitants will be suitably abstract and probably won\u2019t make sense most of the time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reap-and-sow"}
