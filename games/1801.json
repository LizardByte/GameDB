Bentley explained to Sly that the pages of the Thievius Raccoonus were disappearing and that Penelope had also suddenly vanished at the same time. Bentley was looking to re-form the Cooper Gang so that they could stop whomever was altering history. \n \nSly soon met up with Bentley and Murray at their old hideout, where Bentley introduced both of them to the Time Machine. With this device integrated into the Cooper Van, the gang would be able to travel back in time and fix the past. Their first stop was Feudal Japan, but because the Time Machine required an item from that era, they would need to pull a heist to get the item in question. Their target was a nearby museum owned by a seemingly respectable art mogul, a museum that Sly had been keeping tabs on already.", "summary": "Take the Sly Cooper experience on the go when it returns with an epic brand new adventure for the PlayStation Vita system.
