Each track in the game is styled as a unique parking garage that has been turned into a race course.\n\nPlayers will use a map of North America + UK to chart their course from track to track across the globe.\nRally... Circuit?!?\n\nThis is a hybrid of Rally and circuit racing. From rally it draws the jumps and \u201cone racer at a time against the clock\u201d time-trial format.\nHowever, the tracks are similar to circuit racing, with each race consisting of multiple laps around the same track (the track may change slightly from lap to lap, however)\nControls are very tight, simple and arcadey, similar to Mario Kart (accelerate, reverse, steer, drift), but with a bit more dynamic \u201csmash into things\u201d physics.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit", "videos": [{"id": 115187, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "jwjqQn1ad-0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwjqQn1ad-0", "title": "Parking Garage Rally Circuit Official \"Cinematic\" Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwjqQn1ad-0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 115188, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "v6XCzzdeQ6Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6XCzzdeQ6Y", "title": "Parking Garage Rally Circuit Official Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6XCzzdeQ6Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 125640, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "34BUe3_ft4Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34BUe3_ft4Q", "title": "Parking Garage Rally Circuit Release Date Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/34BUe3_ft4Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
