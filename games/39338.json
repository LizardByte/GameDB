The game play is easy during the first five areas but it gets really tough at the later levels where the underwater landscape \"grows\" and there is not much space left for maneuvering the submarine. At the end of each area the boss-submarine appears and its firepower is not easy to overcome. \nUS Billiards, the 800 Fathoms maker, released 10 different machines in our database under this trade name, starting in 1973. \n \nOther machines made by US Billiards during the time period 800 Fathoms was produced include Ab$cam, Variety, US Billiards, Video Pool, Survival, and Shark.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/800-fathoms"}
