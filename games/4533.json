These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens.\n\nGame play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.\n\nAs there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/true-golf-classics-pebble-beach-golf-links"}
