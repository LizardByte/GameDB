This is intended to be a truly challenging experience, but you\u2019ll also find features common to enhancement hacks throughout. All 721 Pok\u00e9mon are available, the leveling curve has been revamped, quality of life improvements are in place, and trainer battles are custom built and significantly harder. Best of all, Ancestral X introduces a number of features never before seen in Gen 6 hacks, including the ORAS Megas, Mobile PC, Trainer Natures, and Custom AI!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-ancestral-x"}
