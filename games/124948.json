To his children, the greatest point of contention at this family conference is the distribution of his inheritance. Everyone desires all that money, no one relents, and no one believes.\n\nWho will gain the old head's vast inheritance? Where is the 10 tons of gold that the old head is said to have hidden? Can the unnerving riddle of the epitaph which is said to point to the location of that gold be solved?\n\nIn the midst of this, a suspicious letter is sent from one claiming to be a witch.\n\nThe presence of a 19th person on this island, which should only have 18, begins to hang in the air. Brutal murders repeat, and unsolvable riddles are left at the scene. How many will die? How many will live? Or will everyone die? Is the culprit one of the 18, or not? Is the culprit a \"human\", or a \"witch\"?\n\nPlease, enjoy this isolated island, western mansion, mystery-suspense gadget of the good old days to the fullest.", "summary": "Welcome to the world of \"Umineko When They Cry\" (When Seagulls Cry).
