You play as Number 6, one of the Soviet Union\u2019s top secret agents, sent by your superiors to infiltrate the dystopian fortress city of Hiawatha and help spark a revolution by destabilizing the local warlord, a massive corporation called Saturn. Sneak or fight your way through a beautifully ugly city- approach mission objectives your own way- solve problems not puzzles. Use loud, quiet, and nonlethal ways to dispatch enemies; lay traps and spring ambushes, or knock guards unconscious and hide them out of sight. Better yet, slink through the shadows, or find a way to the rooftops and sewers, and pass by like a ghost. Use both mind and matter to infiltrate a diverse array of locations in service to the rebel cause, and discover the world of Spectra.", "summary": "A grimy, neon filled immersive sim set in a dystopian alternate history 1972.
