The museum had yet to be opened and has been abandoned and forgotten ever since the professor has mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago, along with 2 students who are suspected to have wandered inside the museum. A collection of ancient South American vessels, believed to contain evil spirits, are removed from their display, opened and scattered all around the museum, with the spirits lurking in every corner. It is your task to find all the matching vessel parts, and capture them again before they can entirely drain your life essence. However, the task becomes harder as the entire museum is covered with puzzles which need to be solved in order to proceed.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shivers", "videos": [{"id": 86078, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-ckBeG_v_HU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ckBeG_v_HU", "title": "Shivers  Preview Trailer for PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ckBeG_v_HU/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1660, "name": "Shivers"}]}
