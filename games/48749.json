Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kaettekita-gunjin-shogi-nanya-sore"}
