It features faithful 3D recreations of two pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: CR Shin Umi Monogatari M8Z and CR Shin Umi Monogatari M6Z. There are two modes available: Ts\u016bj\u014d (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.\n\nPachi-Pro F\u016bunroku returns again with Pachi-Pro F\u016bunroku 3: Saraba Gindama no \u014ckami, concluding the storyline introduced in the first title. The game returns to the adventure style of the first two titles, but adds a much greater degree of freedom to affect the outcome of the story. There are a large number of locations to visit apart from the pachinko parlors, and there are several very different endings that can be reached depending on the player's choice. The relationship system has also returned with several new girls to pursue, for a total of eleven.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sanyou-pachinko-paradise-11-shin-umi-to-saraba-gintama-no-ookami", "videos": [{"id": 136550, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pYqIs6Li7kE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqIs6Li7kE", "title": "\u65b0\u6d77\u7269\u8a9e - \u4e09\u6d0b\u30d1\u30c1\u30f3\u30b3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b911\u301c\u65b0\u6d77\u3068\u3055\u3089\u3070\u9280\u7389\u306e\u72fc\u301c", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pYqIs6Li7kE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
