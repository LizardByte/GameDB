Originally beginning in 2021 as a simple \"overhaul\" of the 2004 game Godzilla: Save the Earth by Pipeworks Studios, STE Melee evolved over the years into an unofficial fully-fledged sequel to the Pipeworks Godzilla games we've all been waiting for! As originally a PS2 game, STEM runs in an emulator, so it can only be played on PC/Linux/Steam Deck. STE Melee has not yet been released, as it's a huge, all-encompassing remaster that includes additional content. There's no estimated release date as this is a completely free project done out of passion. In the meantime, please enjoy these windows into our development!)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GodzillaSTE\ndiscord.gg/2ZqbppAMkY", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDNyVoeX9qY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDNyVoeX9qY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDNyVoeX9qY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDNyVoeX9qY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "ORGA - Gameplay Trailer \u2502 STE: Melee", "description": "He's gonna get ya with his big ol' slappy hands!\nStay tuned for more STEM updates!\n\n(Godzilla: Save the Earth - Melee is a fan-made mod project by Godzilla fans for Godzilla fans.
