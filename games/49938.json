There's no need for a separate digital organizer anymore, as you can now keep track of your life on a Game Boy Color. Everyone's favorite little alien being provides a calendar, an address book, a working clock, and even a \"to-do\" list that will keep young science fiction fans motivated and productive. There are even five mini-games included, several of which involves helping the titular mascot evade the authorities and collect the necessary items to construct an inter-global telephone system. One of the games challenges you to raise a \"Flopgopple\" pet, and all of the options are compatible with the Nintendo Game Boy Printer. Kids can even protect all of their personal data with the use of an original password.
