Frogs make Sid grow longer, which makes things more dangerous as you mustn't crash into anything - this includes your own body and the walls of the garden!  Every time you eat a frog, a new toad enters the garden. Toads are poisonous to Sid, so you must avoid these too. However, every now and then a magic mushroom will grow which, when eaten, will allow you to eat one toad without coming to any harm! Once the garden is cleared of frogs, it's on to the next area. Sid is provided with three lives with which to score as much as he can.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ8_D4HHbJs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ8_D4HHbJs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ8_D4HHbJs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ8_D4HHbJs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Slippery Sid (1983 / 2020 re-crack) Walkthrough, ZX Spectrum", "description": "Huge playlist archive with games from 1982-1992: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3uy0uOIHzPaxfOp53uJLX7-\nMany more games from the 80s can be found here:\nRacing games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3vkkE35mCw6x63QFBnU9Xsi\nAY / GFX improved games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3t74YnYAJA9p4vMQYZYCJWX\nA classic game now in a new version with Andy Green's loading screen from 2020.
