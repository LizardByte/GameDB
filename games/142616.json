Users can select from nine different characters and form a team to battle against enemies while performing special moves recreated from the anime. The combat is called a \"real-time auto battle\" system which mainly focuses on the user inputting the commands/timing for the use of special moves.\n\nThe main quests of the game features story progression through each season of the anime. However, because there are some characters whose role in the story is limited, there are also new stories that feature them, including \"daily life\" scenarios in addition to \"battle\" scenarios.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
