Attend classes in person, get to know your teachers, hang out in the cafeteria, and even decorate your locker. Your most treasured moments might happen while loitering around with your friends after school.\n\nIconic teen moments \u2014 Dance the night away at prom and celebrate your graduation ceremony (if you keep up with your schoolwork). In addition to those big moments, Sims can make lifelong friends, participate in after-school activities and teams, and experience the rollercoaster ride of puberty.\n\nShake things up \u2014 High school is a time of self-discovery. Find the confidence to ask out your crush or the guts to skip class (don\u2019t let the principal catch you). Teen Sims will explore their own likes and dislikes, and have new opportunities to cause mischief. Pranks and sneaking out after dark can have consequences, so be careful you don\u2019t get caught.\n\nExplore your style \u2014 Make your bedroom your own, plan outfits with clothes designed by Depop sellers, and become a Simfluencer. Teen Sims can earn money by selling outfits and hyping up looks they design on Trendi right from their bedrooms, which are now more interactive than ever. Use a tablet, read a book in bed, or even have a pillow fight!", "summary": "Class is in session!
