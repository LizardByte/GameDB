A boy named Kyle must rescue the princess of a kingdom where very small humans and animals peacefully co-exist.\n\nRipple Island (occasionally seen translated as \"Lipple Island\") is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the world using a series of commands, such as \"pick up\", \"walk\" or \"use\".\n\nRather than the usual murder mystery games which were the trend at the time, Ripple Island instead adopts a fantasy storybook setting where smaller humans and friendly animals, such as raccoons and rabbits, co-exist peacefully. The kingdom is threatened by the arrival of Gerogeru, a self-styled Emperor of Darkness and giant frog, after he kidnaps the princess. Kyle, a young boy and the game's protagonist, is attempting to rescue her.\n\nThe game was never released outside of Japan. It was, however, re-released as part of a Japan-only PS2 compilation based on Sunsoft's works. It also received a manga adaptation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ripple-island", "videos": [{"id": 110925, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Sr19u8CmKl8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr19u8CmKl8", "title": "\u3010\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u3011\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 OP\uff5eED (1988\u5e74) \u3010FC \u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3011\u3010NES Ripple Island\u3000Playthrough  (Full Games)\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sr19u8CmKl8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
