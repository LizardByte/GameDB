{"id": "S5qKt-xHnH0", "snippet": {"title": "Puyo Pop Fever 2 (PS2 Gameplay)", "description": "Unlike all the other games in the series so far, Puyo Puyo Fever 2 uses a map system to let the player navigate the game's menus. The map system is also reused in story mode to show the supposed path of the player's character. Several buildings are available around the map area, known as Primp Town, which was the setting of the previous game. These buildings include a tower for endless modes, a shop to buy items, a town hall to change options and save, a museum for viewing unlocked media and a playground for multiplayer games. You can also explore these areas and talk to the people there, where they may give you items.\r\nThe courses in this game work in much the same fashion as those of the prequel, with the addition of the aforementioned map screen to show the player's route so far. Each part of the story involves a segment of dialog followed by a Puyo battle, with the exception of the ending sequence of each course. Gameplay mechanics are exactly the same as the previous game, except for the addition of an items system, where the player can choose any item in their inventory to use at the beginning of a match. Items have various functions, such as allowing you to play as another character, dumping nuisance puyo on an opponent at the beginning, making attacks more powerful, setting up a chain for you to start with, or starting you with a couple points on your fever counter. Common items can be bought at Oshare Bones' shop.\r\nThe game boasts nine courses, three times that of the original Puyo Puyo Fever. Each of the three main characters (Amitie, Raffine, and Sig) has three courses on three difficulties: RunRun (easy), WakuWaku (medium), and HaraHara (hard); each with different stories.\r\nThe game also includes a new save system which is not used in any other game to date. It allows three concurrent save files, and lets players save at the beginning of any Puyo battle in story mode, so a player does not have to finish an entire course at once but can stop partway through.\r\nCHU puyo were also introduced in this game, but serve no functional purpose as they act the same as ordinary nuisance puyo and the only mode in which they appear (Endless CHU Panic) does not contain the ordinary variant. The only differences are that CHU puyo are pink in colour and heart shaped. It appears in the opening movie.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5qKt-xHnH0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5qKt-xHnH0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5qKt-xHnH0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5qKt-xHnH0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Puyo Pop Fever 2 (PS2 Gameplay)", "description": "Unlike all the other games in the series so far, Puyo Puyo Fever 2 uses a map system to let the player navigate the game's menus.
