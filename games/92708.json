Both games come with unchanged graphics straight from their flash-based originals.\n\nElf Bowling is a standard bowling game, where the player as Santa hurls a bowling ball down an alley at belligerents elves. This is done by pressing a button at the right moment as a red cone moves left and right along the bottom of the lower screen.\n\nElf Bowling 2 is a game of shuffleboard. The goal of the game is to hurl Elves down the deck into a score zone at the end of the ship. This is done by aiming the elf left and right with the D-pad, and hitting A-button at the right moment as a light slides across the grid in front of the player's character.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elf-bowling-1-and-2", "videos": [{"id": 80775, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "c-baGwdpEsg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-baGwdpEsg", "title": "Elf Bowling 1 & 2 (GBA) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 80776, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WznPdb4vy_E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WznPdb4vy_E", "title": "Elf Bowling 1&2 Nintendo DS Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WznPdb4vy_E/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
