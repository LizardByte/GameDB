How about roaming through industrial space station with grappling hooks and spatial boosters like a space Indiana Jones?

Arcade platforming like you haven't seen before. Spatial riddles where you need to be both dexterous and quick-thinking. All bathed in gritty, Slavik, humorous story and wacky acrobatics you simply WON'T find ANYWHERE else.\n\n[So, my dear comrade...\n...ready to become the Space Soviet Tarzan...?\u200d\n\nTarget platforms: HTC Vive / Oculus Rift\nRelease date: 27.08.2020\n\nAvailable today on VIVEPORT: https://www.viveport.com/90052cfc-f3da-4052-abd8-c182f6f9b99a\n\nLater today on:\nSTEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352020/Yupitergrad/\nOCULUS STORE: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/app/2521589964574061/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKIsAvy-imM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKIsAvy-imM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKIsAvy-imM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKIsAvy-imM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKIsAvy-imM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Yupitergrad | Launch Trailer", "description": "\u2581 \u2582 \u2584 \u2585 \u2586 \u2587 \u2588\ud83d\udca0\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude50\ud835\ude4e \ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude4f\ud83d\udca0\u2588 \u2587 \u2586 \u2585 \u2584 \u2582 \u2581\n\ud83d\udcac\u3010\ud835\ude73\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude73\u3011https://discord.gg/ZUQfuxgjru\n\ud83d\udcf0\u3010\ud835\ude75\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude71\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude7a\u3011https://www.facebook.com/Gamedust\n\ud83e\udd86\u3010\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude86\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude81\u3011https://twitter.com/GamedustTT\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\u3010\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7c\u3011https://store.steampowered.com/dev/GameDust\n\ud83d\udcf7\u3010\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude76\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7c\u3011https://www.instagram.com/gamedust_studio/\n\nYupitergrad | Launch Trailer\n\n[Can you imagine VR game almost free of motion sickness or headaches?
