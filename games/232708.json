It's not bigwig hollywood software, but it's well worth the price and extremely easy to learn and use. You can use any 3D clipart, including the images in the clipart package included, or you can even use digital photos of family and friends. So if you've always wanted to make a game but don't want to learn computer code, this is a great way to get started. You can save an unlimited number of games, and there is no limit to how big each game can be! I not only helped create the program, I use it all the time! It also comes with a great instruction manual in .rtf format. Check it out!", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rpg-workshop-max"}
