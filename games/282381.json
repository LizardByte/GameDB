There are no right or wrong choices.\n\nThe last section, Melody Madness, evolved around numbered bottles which are filled with different amounts of water. The three mini-games are: - Clicking on the correct bottles (the correct numbers are written out) to re-create a song. Alternatively the player can use the bottles freely to create a new melody. - A Simon Says variant. - Filling the bottles with the correct amount of water in order to match the given music notes.\n\nAll mini-games were already included in previous entries of the series.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gus-and-the-cyberbuds-stellar-game-center", "videos": [{"id": 104724, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1Q_-p3bhqGk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q_-p3bhqGk", "title": "Gus and the Cyberbuds: Stellar Game Cellar (PC, Windows) [1996] longplay.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1Q_-p3bhqGk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
