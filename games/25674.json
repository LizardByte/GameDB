Enter the tomb, outwit the ghost guards and get the treasure. . . . .\n\nThis sounds easy, but it is not, because the people of the pharao does not live any more but all lockings and traps still work well. Furthermore, evil bugs, rolling and falling rocks, magma and bats obstruct the search. And finally, some tunnels and channels are very narrow so that our brave treasure hunter (or tomb raider) must crawl through them to avoid hurting his head.\n\nIn the unlikely event that you find all seals and get to the guards of the treasure, the most dagnerous task will follow, as you need to pass the guard without touching it. If this succeeds the adventurer will be awarded the Treasure of the Pharao, if not he will die a cruel death. . .", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/caverns-of-khafka", "videos": [{"id": 111554, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eEwMFdxzAFs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEwMFdxzAFs", "title": "C64-Longplay - Caverns Of Khafka (720p)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eEwMFdxzAFs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
