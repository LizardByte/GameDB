Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.\n\nThe game was available as a standard upright cabinet The controls consist of a 4-way joystick and two buttons, one for \"shoot\" and the other for jumping and kicking.
