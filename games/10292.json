This isn\u2019t your typical attack fighter, you\u2019ll be flying sorties under the cover of night, avoiding detection by enemy radar and striking high-value targets with precision weaponry. You\u2019ll want to haunt the battlefield like a ghost, menacing the enemy with earth-shattering ordnance before vanishing in your airborne apparition as suddenly as you appeared.\n\nWith a hardcore devotion to authenticity, F-117A brings you unprecedented night combat action. You\u2019ll go through every phase of mission planning, from requesting a specific assignment during briefing to choosing your own munitions during armament, before then climbing into your cockpit and experiencing the thrill of dropping 1,000 lbs. of laser-guided destruction on enemy troops, tanks and bunkers. This is your chance to fly one of the most technologically impressive warplanes ever made.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nighthawk-f-117a-stealth-fighter-2-dot-0", "videos": [{"id": 18013, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "v4tTcK4z4qs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4tTcK4z4qs", "title": "NightHawk F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v4tTcK4z4qs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
