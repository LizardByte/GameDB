For both PC and VR.\n\nWhat makes Derail Valley different?\n\nYou can feel the physics. Walk without restrictions, in and out of locomotives, changing them as you see fit. Couple and uncouple trains as you complete your deliveries. Choose new deliveries freely. Take many at once if you will. Service your trains after derailing. Do this all spontaneously, and at any point you can save and continue later.\n\nBuilt from the ground up for Virtual Reality - optional\n\nDerail Valley fully supports playing on a regular PC, using mouse and keyboard on a flat screen, but virtual reality is where it really shines. In VR you can, for the first time ever, truly be inside train cabs and operate controls with your own hands. Derail Valley supports all major PC VR headsets, such as Oculus, Windows Mixed Reality, Valve and HTC.", "videos": [{"id": 35494, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "f_XCdfc-Exk"}]}
