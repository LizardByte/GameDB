The squad is deployed to clear out various incursions on Freeze's world, dubbed \"Frozen Earth\". Afterward, they are tasked with escorting Freeze and her cryogenically frozen wife, Nora, to Earth-1. Having ensured Nora's safety, Freeze agrees to join the squad. The squad confronts the fourth Brainiac, who uses a combination of the Flash and Superman's powers to combat them but is ultimately defeated. The squad successfully retrieves the Flash, uncorrupted, and returns to Earth-1, where the latter is put into stasis for recovery. Freeze proceeds to study the Flash, which also helps to accelerate her progress on finding a cure for Nora, though she begins to notice an inconsistency between Brainiac's actions and his strategy. The squad continues their work on Frozen Earth, and eventually defeats the fifth Brainiac.", "summary": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League \u2013 Season of Freeze launched on July 25, 2024, adding Mrs. Freeze as a playable character, a frozen Elseworld location, new missions, Infamy gear sets, and a Battle Pass with themed cosmetics.
