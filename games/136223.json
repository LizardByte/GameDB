The gameplay and levels are however entirely new, so it is only a remake in the sense that it re-envisions the character and the setting of the original game. Fairburne is an American agent of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) who is disguised as a German sniper and is inserted in the Battle of Berlin in 1945 during the final days of World War II. In the original game he was after intel about the German nuclear warfare program. In this game he needs to hunt down German V-2 rocket scientists.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sniper-elite-v2-silver-star-edition"}
