The game features a single-player story mode in which players take the role of Tequila and fight their way through cities such as Hong Kong and Chicago to locate the missing child who is held captive by mafia members and gangsters. Players will have the opportunity to earn style points by performing such moves as running up banisters while shooting and when enough points are acquired gamers can execute moves that include the \"Tequila Bomb\" or enter \"Tequila Time.\" \"Tequila Time\" is a sequence during a gunfight when enemies are slowed down while players maintain their speed, making it easier to hit enemy targets. Up to eight players can get involved in multiplayer action through the Internet, and the environments within the game are fully destructible and interactive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stranglehold", "videos": [{"id": 29198, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fKDayRrQ0Gs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKDayRrQ0Gs", "title": "John Woo Presents Stranglehold E3 2007 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fKDayRrQ0Gs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119218, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "N76FP_b6qw8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N76FP_b6qw8", "title": "John Woo Presents Stranglehold PlayStation 3 Trailer - E3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N76FP_b6qw8/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 15553, "name": "James Wong"}, {"id": 15563, "name": "Golden Kane Phone Message Thug, Detective 1, Junk, Boat Captain, Golden Kane Mega Thug"}, {"id": 15560, "name": "Damon Zakarov"}, {"id": 15561, "name": "Yung Gi"}, {"id": 15565, "name": "Detective 2"}, {"id": 15562, "name": "Golden Kane, Rabbit Thug, 19 Teahouse thug, Aged Merchant"}, {"id": 15564, "name": "Golden Kane, Teahouse thug"}, {"id": 15566, "name": "Kwong Fang (aka Solid Gold)"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Inspector Tequila"}, {"id": 15554, "name": "Jerry Ying"}, {"id": 15555, "name": "Vlad Zakarov & Dapang"}, {"id": 15556, "name": "Billie Wong"}, {"id": 15557, "name": "Ty Lok & Chopper Pilot"}, {"id": 15558, "name": "Teko Wong"}, {"id": 15559, "name": "Captain Ed Lee"}, {"id": 2213, "name": "Himself"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
