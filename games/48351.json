Released on the Nintendo Family Computer console in Japan in 1991.\n\nBig Adventure is a children's puzzle game where Keroppi must rescue his girlfriend Keroleen who is locked up in a castle. To do so, he must solve the action based puzzles in seven differently themed worlds with four different types of stages (the surface of the maze, flying a plane, a Reversi-like level, and through a field of lava). All the items in the game are pre-determined; there is a need to memorize the pattern for each playthrough so that a player may advance through the levels more quickly once they have achieved a degree of expertise in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kero-kero-keroppi-no-daibouken"}
