{"id": "tOjRa97WGpE", "snippet": {"title": "Strange Terror From The Deep | Unreleased/Unfinished Content Update Showcase", "description": "Thought I'd finally get around to recording a, \"No Commentary\" showcase of STFTD's update that was never finished/released. I totally understand if folks are frustrated that I never finished this and will continue to wanna poke me about it, but I have my reasons why I dropped it. I just wasn't feeling motivated anymore and wanted to move on to other projects. I honestly got really tired of always going back to older games and updating them. I usually only do it if it's something relatively simple, but usually not this big. I guess because the update grew to such a degree that it felt like I was remaking the game, that I just said screw it and stopped working on it.\n\nIt's too late now for me to release a mini version of the update with just the font changes and other misc improvements. Too many big changes are still there, like the map rework and only 10% of the characters being rigged and animated. I don't want to go about removing some of these things for the sake of releasing a smaller version of the update, y'know. Anyway, sorry for rambling, enjoy the video!\n\nGet Doomy in the Roomy + more over on my Patreon! \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/DaveMicrowavesGames\n\n\nMy Twitter! \u25ba https://twitter.com/The_Toonimator\n\n\nMy Website! \u25ba https://davemicrowavesgames.wixsite.com/davemicrowavesgames\n\n\nMy Merch! \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/the-microwave-merch-shop\n\n\n#DaveMicrowavesGames #StrangeTerrorFromTheDeep #STFTD", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tOjRa97WGpE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tOjRa97WGpE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tOjRa97WGpE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tOjRa97WGpE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tOjRa97WGpE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Strange Terror From The Deep | Unreleased/Unfinished Content Update Showcase", "description": "Thought I'd finally get around to recording a, \"No Commentary\" showcase of STFTD's update that was never finished/released.
