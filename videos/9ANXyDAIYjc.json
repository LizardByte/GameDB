This is a mod Directed by Marco Antonio: https://twitter.com/MarcoJurez19\nhttps://gamejolt.com/@Marco_Antonio\n\nThis mod has everything you could ever want in a Mario Creepypasta mod including Mario Kart. Amazing art, a lot of cool art, man the art is so amazing. The songs are awesome too.\n\nEdit: Why do I keep referring to this as a Mario '85 PC Port mod? MX isn't even the main character here, it's actually Ultra M. Anyway, this is one of the most popular Mario mods in FNF. In this mod, we play as Boyfriend, and with the help of Girlfriend, we must face off against various creepypasta versions of Mario characters / Super Mario Bros Games. We go up against Beta Luigi / Dead Luigi from the first Luigi\u2019s Mansion trailer, IHY Luigi, Wario Apparition, Mario Land, MX from MARIO 85' PC Port, Race Mario, Devil Mario and so much more cuz I can't fit them all in description.\n\nSo the story is similar to the Lucas Story from Mario '85 PC Port, basically, BF and GF got a copy of Super Mario Bros Nes game and they ended up getting sucked into the TV by MX himself\n\nVS Friday Night Funkin': Mario's Madness V2 Mod Download link:\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/359554\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/mariosmadness/693301\n\n--\n\u25ba Disclaimer: This video is intended for viewers aged 13+ and older.\n--\nAll Songs from Friday Night Funkin' VS Mario's Madness V2 Full Week Mod Timestamp:\n00:00 Preview (spoiler alert)\n02:24 Title Screen\n02:41 Menu\n03:15 Week List\n03:24 Cutscenes 1\n06:54 1) It's a Me (Lore Context appears before in every song)\n09:04 Times up\n10:34 Cutscenes 2\n10:55 2) Starman Slaughter\n12:01 Parabones\n13:00 Peach & Yoshi\n14:04 Mario Attacks\n15:00 Cutscenes 3\n15:58 Overworld\n16:34 3) So Cool\n19:33 4) Nourishing Blood\n21:22 Transition\n22:24 5) MARIO SING AND GAME RYTHM 9\n24:24 Spotlight\n25:51 Overworld (Heading to next world)\n26:18 6) Alone\n27:23 Luigi's Mansion\n29:37 Mario Painting\n31:14 7) Thalassophobia\n33:47 Eel (Super Mario 64)\n35:10 8) Oh God No\n36:28 Princess Peach - Sad Ending\n37:20 If CLICK Mushroom, he gets mad\n37:57 Cutscenes 4\n38:17 9) I Hate You\n39:56 Lava rises\n40:15 Mario appear & BF pushes Luigi\n40:50 10) Apparition\n41:31 Wario will show you fun\n43:21 11) Last Course\n46:36 12) Dark Forest\n47:51 Dialogue\n48:24 Transition\n48:56 Overworld (Heading to next world)\n49:22 13) Bad Day\n50:25 Mario jumps on my arrows\n51:45 Yahoo\n52:56 14) Day Out\n54:37 Dialogue\n55:50 Dialogue\n56:17 15) Dictator\n59:00 End\n59:17 16) Race-traitors\n01:01:12 Kratos\n01:01:28 17) No Hope\n01:04:20 Overworld (Heading to the next world)\n01:05:10 18) Golden Land\n01:05:55 Evil\n01:06:21 GF\n01:07:44 No Party Opening\n01:08:08 19) No Party\n01:10:52 20) Paranoia\n01:12:36 Fake GF\n01:14:50 Overworld\n01:15:04 Cutscenes 5\n01:15:38 21) Overdue\n01:16:00 Mr. L (Too Late.exe) Reveal himself\n01:17:04 Transition\n01:17:55 Ghost Mario appears\n01:18:30 Pico Run\n01:19:33 22) Powerdown\n01:20:23 MX appear\n01:22:23 Innocence doesn't get you far\n01:23:12 23) Demise\n01:25:20 Underground\n01:26:16 GF saves BF\n01:26:54 Overworld (Heading to the next world)\n01:27:10 Cutscenes 6\n01:27:49 24) Promotion\n01:28:49 Luigi on TV\n01:29:09 Evil Mario, Luigi & Peach\n01:31:10 Cutscenes 7\n01:31:31 25) Abandoned\n01:32:08 Water mechanic\n01:35:20 26) The End Song\n01:37:13 1st person view & GF in danger\n01:37:44 Overworld Glitched\n01:38:16 Mario's Speech\n01:39:54 All Stars Act 1\n01:41:42 All Stars Act 2\n01:43:38 All Stars Act 3\n01:44:54 Lyrics\n01:45:46 All Stars Act 4\n01:47:30 BF tries to avenge his gf\n01:48:37 Credits\n01:51:42 The End & Something Unlocked + Overworld\n01:52:19 27) Unbeatable (VS Nintendo Man)\n01:55:18 Duck Hunt\n01:57:50 Bowser\n01:59:30 Puyo Puyo & BF Solo\n02:00:32 You can not beat us\n02:02:14 Everyone\n02:03:00 Calling Luigi & Game over dialogues\n02:05:40 Game Over Animations (Major ones)\n02:13:27 Outro/Extras - CommunityGame\n\nMod Creators for VS MX - Mario's Madness 2.0 below:\nVS Mario's Madness V2 FULL WEEK (Cutscenes/Cinematic!)
