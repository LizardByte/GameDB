This fantastical realm is a system of floating islands, carved from the land we once called home, now encased in radically advanced energy shields known as Domes and suspended high above the clouds. Today, the Architects are long gone yet their legacy remains. Each one of them has hidden a Vault, that contains secret and powerful knowledge. But something sinister is afoot. A shadowy figure known only as Architect 13, whose whereabouts are unknown, his true identity concealed, and his motives unclear.", "summary": "Cornucopias is a multiplayer open-world game set in an alternate universe where humanity thrives above an earth in ruin. This new world in the sky is anchored by a new technology powered by the element Genesium, which ironically is what caused a planet-wide calamity.

In this vast new world, the choices are yours, and the path to success is yours to carve.
