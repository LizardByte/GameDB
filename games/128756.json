You\u2019re greeted by your favourite emotions: regret for a weekend ill-spent, heartbreak at being wrenched from blissful slumber, and dismay at another thankless week stretched out before you. \n \nSo begins the undressing: \n \n* You remove your eye-mask from your face. \n* You remove your earplugs from your ears. \n* You remove your phone from your mouth. \n \nThis isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve found it in there, with no memory of having inserted it the night before. \n \nIt all started that one morning when you suddenly needed to bolt for the bus after fiddling with your phone, and, unable to put it away in time, you placed it in your mouth, screen downward. \n \nIt was only inside for a second, but the taste\u2026! As soon as you\u2019d hopped on the bus, you\u2019d removed, wiped it down, and pocketed it, your tongue burning. \n \nYou thought, at the time, that this was the taste of months of finger smears. But, no - it was the taste of pure data. \n \nA taste you\u2019ve begun to crave.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phone-in-mouth"}
