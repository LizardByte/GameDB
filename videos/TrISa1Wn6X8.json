Back in the late 70's the country was rockin' out to disco and Star Wars, and this game was inspired by both. More Star Wars though, which came out in 1977 and launched actors like Chewbacca and Darth Vader to world wide fame. This game was release in 1978.\n\nThis is old-school, retro, vintage, arcade gaming at its finest. Two player action, you pilot space ships (the same ones from Asteroids I think) and shoot at each other. It's basically Combat in space, or Battlestar Galactica (the old series) mixed with the A-Team.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
