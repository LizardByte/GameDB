Imca has particularly low resistance to the cold and tried to figure out a way to fend off the chill during the night, but the squad did not have any extra blankets. Concerned with Imca's comfort, Kurt offered to let her use his blanket, but she refused to leave him vulnerable to the cold. With few options left, Kurt suggested that they share the blanket, and though Imca was a bit embarrassed at first, she eventually agreed. Imca got a good night's rest and even asked Kurt if they could sleep under the same circumstances again the next night. Unfortunately for Imca, Riela discovered the two sharing their sleeping quarters and interrogated Imca about it to no end.", "summary": "No.1 is Restless is a downloadable content of Valkyria Chronicles 3.
