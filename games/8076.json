For the most part Speedy will run, run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. There are also mousetraps which function similarly to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into the air. Speedy has a short range kick for attacking and can occasionally pick up items and use them at a later time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/speedy-gonzales-los-gatos-bandidos"}
