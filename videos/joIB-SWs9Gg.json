If the ball falling from the paddle, the player loses a life. There are power-ups that help to the player (like extra life, weapons to break blocks easily, increase and reduce paddle and more).\n\nThe 3D is for the perspective, which is rotatable horizontal and vertical, but it also relates to the level structure, which is multi-layer. You always play at the ground layer, but as soon as the brick there is destroyed, any brick of a higher layer will fall down.\n\nThe game offers a basic level pack and three bonus packs, all totaling in 200 levels.\n\nThere are a lot of power-ups in the game, ranging from very good to very bad. For example: paddle shrinker and expander, slow ball & fast ball, magnetic paddle, multiball, fireball (ignites adjacent bricks), the all destroying ball, many different weapons for the paddle (gun, rockets, chemical rockets, etc.), Earthquake (will shake the screen), Level Skipper, Death \"power-up\" (will instantly kill the paddle), Day & Night power-ups, and many more.\n\nThe weapon power-ups wearing not just off when you collect another power-up, but they also have only a limited ammunition. In example, the conventional rockets have an ammunition of 3 rockets, so you can't blow up the entire level with them.\n\nRelease Dates -  ~2004\nGenre - Arcade, Paddle / Pong\nPlatforms - Windows\nDeveloper - Dream Dale\nPublisher - Alawar Entertainment, Inc., Big Fish Games\n\nMy Xbox gamertag: Shad0wx54x\nMy PlayStation gamertag: ToughGamingGuyYT\n\nWanna see more of my fantastic walkthroughs?
