This port adds new events that provides more backstory to the story. However, this port also has washed out colors and lower quality music than its PlayStation counterpart, due to hardware capabilities of Game Boy Advance. This is the only version of Shin Megami Tensei that got an official English localization with its iOS release.\n\nThe gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-megami-tensei--3", "collections": [{"id": 1291, "name": "Shin Megami Tensei"}]}
