Told as a linear narrative, there are no choices, and there are no alternate endings. Sit and stay for a moment, before leaving.\n\nTaking the form of a short visual novel, this is a short story of sorts about grief, moving on, and life in the rural Midwest. As a \"kinetic novel\" there are no alternative routes or choices- just one storyline to follow to its inevitable conclusion. Placing an emphasis on a small, curated experience, it is best experienced in one sitting.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/backwater-eulogy"}
