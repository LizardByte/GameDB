A fantastic land where rubies grow on trees and magic abounds. Who would imagine that a land so idyllic would spawn a murderer so demented? Some say that the court jester, Malcolm, was mad to begin with. Others whisper in sly, conspiratorial tones\nthat it was his burning desire to possess the precious Kyragem that slowly drove him to slay the peaceful King William.\n\nAs the rightful prince of Kyrandia, you must pursue the elusive Malcolm to recover the powerful gemstone. Only then will you be able to reclaim the throne and restore harmony to the land of Kyrandia. The Legend of Kyrandia awaits you!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-kyrandia", "videos": [{"id": 33367, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4nkkdQkQqx8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nkkdQkQqx8", "title": "The Legend of Kyrandia - trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nkkdQkQqx8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
