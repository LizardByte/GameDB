At present, humans and a race called Yasons are having a prolonged conflict. The hero of the game, a young adventurer named Calintz, comes back to his hometown, only to discover that it was destroyed by enemies. Thinking only about revenge, Calintz embarks on a journey that will eventually force him to get involved in the world of conflicts, wars, and intrigues.\n\nMagna Carta: Tears of Blood is a Korean-made RPG in Japanese style, and a sequel to Phantom of Avalanche; it is set in the same world and has the same protagonist. The game's combat system is turn-based at core, but requires the player to press buttons in a rapid succession and with precise timing to execute attacks. The characters can store up energy to unleash a stronger attack later. Using the technique named Carta, they can also perform various special moves which are based on elemental affinities.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magna-carta-tears-of-blood", "videos": [{"id": 132263, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7nJvuYP5eLU"}]}
