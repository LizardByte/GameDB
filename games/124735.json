{"id": 124735, "name": "Panzer Campaigns: Salerno '43 Gold", "slug": "panzer-campaigns-salerno-43-gold", "summary": "Salerno '43 - The invasion of Salerno in September 1943 and Anzio in January 1944 were two very different operations. At Salerno the US and British troops ran into a stubborn enemy determine to throw them back into the sea. So, five months later at Anzio, they acted with caution, building up their force before moving inland - but the delay allowed the Germans to pocket them into the beachhead - one that proved difficult and costly to break out of. In this Panzer Campaign title you can try your hand in command of both of these critical Allied amphibious operations that lead up to Normandy. As a bonus you can also play the German Air Assault on Crete in 1941 to round out the action in the Mediterranean.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/panzer-campaigns-salerno-43-gold"}
