The goal of the map redesigns is to change the feel of the areas, as well as adding new surprises and challenges, in hopes of reigniting the excitement of a first playthrough.\n\nThe three basic magic schools of vanilla have each been split into four distinct sub-schools, making 12 in total. Each of the new spell schools have their own distinct playstyle and progression, as well as custom spells, catalysts, vendors and armor.\n\nInfusions for all weapons have been completely overhauled, making every weapon viable.\n\nAll bosses have been revamped in some way, and some are even completely new.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls-iii-the-convergence"}
