Instead, it is an homage to it, retaining the same beat-em-up gameplay, but featuring new characters from later seasons of The Simpsons, such as Chief Wiggum, Bumblebee Man and Mayor Quimby. Players attack enemies with punches and kicks, and can find power-ups in the form of other Simpsons family members, who appear on-screen briefly to give assistance in beating up foes.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-simpsons-arcade"}
