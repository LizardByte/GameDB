But as any normal person, He now needs a break. So, as God takes a week\u2019s vacation and goes to Canc\u00fan, you need to replace Him and do His job.\nThe game is a gravity simulation based on Newton\u2019s law of universal gravity where you control the speed and direction of a single planet. You\u2019ll need to find the precise trajectory of this planet to make it orbit around another celestial body.\nA lot of features are offered to diversify the different challenges at hand.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gods-orbits"}
