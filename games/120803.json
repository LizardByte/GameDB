Other than that the gameplay is almost identical to the original game. As the bricks fall from the top of the screen the player can move them left or right and rotate them. For each line cleared the player earns points and the game goes on until the bricks reaches the top of the screen. The aim is simply to get the highest score possible and reach a high position in the high score chart. Before starting out it's possible to choose the speed of the game (0-9) but unlike the original Tetris the speed is constant and doesn't increase as the game goes on.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/komuves-kelemen"}
