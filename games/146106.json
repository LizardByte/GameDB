You can wander through these ancient halls, if you dare.", "summary": "In a free literary adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, Castle Elsinore offers the opportunity to explore the namesake castle from the play to collect as much treasure as possible and deposit it at the town hall of the nearby village.
