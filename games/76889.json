Controls are very basic: the character can jump and throw his hat to take out enemies such as butlers, thugs, crabs, birds and alligators. Meanwhile he can collect coins and items such as drinks for points. After a certain number of points a new life is granted. Nick has three lives and three health points per life. He can also pick up a yellow hat. This changes his costume and allows him to throw his hat farther. There are short conversations with characters, some bosses and animated cut-scenes between levels.", "summary": "The Great Gatsby is a platform game inspired by the 1925 novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Loosely borrowing characters and locations from the original story, players guide Nick Carraway through four main levels. The game is jokingly said to be a localized, unreleased port of the Japanese NES game Doki Doki Toshokan: Gatsby no Monogatari and the developers even made up fake advertisements, credits and a cartridge photo. It is however an entirely original browser game created to resemble a NES platformer from the 8-bit era.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-great-gatsby", "videos": [{"id": 127635, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nfJxFMZQRLc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfJxFMZQRLc", "title": "The Great Gatsby [NES] Fullplay (Retro Nostalgia)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nfJxFMZQRLc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
