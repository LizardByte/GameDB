These so-called \"fit battles\" play out like a traditional turn-based RPG. All of your attacks are triggered by completing a specific pose or stretch, with four attack types that target different parts of your body\n\nThe world will be broken up into courses that, upon completion, reward you with experience points. Levelling up will increase your character's base stats and slowly unlock new skills that can be utilised in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 47836, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "skBNiJd61Qw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skBNiJd61Qw", "title": "Ring Fit Adventure Overview Trailer - Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skBNiJd61Qw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
