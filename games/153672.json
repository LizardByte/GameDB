Especially when you don't have a single clue how you got there to begin with.\n\nUnfortunately, it's what Alec has to deal with tonight. It's cold, the wind's bitter, and he simply can't remember what happened earlier in the night. It must have been something big.\n\nAt least he finds a bus stop for shelter, but given it's a bus stop, he's not the only one there waiting.\n\nAlec has two choices before him. Ignore the stranger's attempts to converse (he could be a serial killer, after all) and wait for the bus, or engage him (what else is there to do stranded at a bus stop) and see what happens.\n\nThe choice is yours.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-morning-star"}
