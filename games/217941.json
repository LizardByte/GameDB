A true 16-bit, nostalgic platforming experience running on genuine SEGA hardware, that will make fans of SEGA's golden era feel warm and fuzzy.\n\nSimilar games simply do not exist on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis. And, there aren't that many isometric games for the console, either.\nNow, based on this engine, we will try to create a full-fledged game. Naturally, we will have to work hard, but I hope that we will succeed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bio-evil"}
