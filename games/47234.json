Energy is lost when players come into contact with an inhabitant. Up to three weapons can be used to destroy the inhabitants. Once all the droids have been collected, players make their way to the next planet where new inhabitants are introduced and the number of droids to be collected increases. Players have a limited amount of time to do this, but as well as energy and ammo, it can be replenished by purchasing more at the shop (only one shop per planet).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberdyne-warrior"}
