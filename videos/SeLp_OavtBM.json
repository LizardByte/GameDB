{"id": "SeLp_OavtBM", "snippet": {"title": "Batman Returns (SMS) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1991 movie-license based platformer for the Sega Master System, Batman Returns. \n\nThis video shows two separate playthroughs of the game: the first shows all of the \"Route 1\" versions of each stage. The second (beginning at 26:11) playthrough shows all of the \"Route 2\" versions, and is SIGNIFICANTLY harder.\n\nBatman Returns for the Master System was an interesting throwback to much older platformers for a game released in 1991. It looks and sounds great, but its huge level of challenge is largely attributable to the extremely precise timing that the game requires when you're using the grappling hook. There's virtually zero room for error, but at least it's pretty magnanimous with the extra lives it hands out. I couldn't count how many times I swore over the time I played this. That Route 1 path is deceptively easy - the game on Route 2, in my opinion, is a fair amount harder than the original Batman game on the NES. \n\nIt's a lot of fun. Just be prepared for some pain before jumping in. If you can get used to the controls and the perfect timings they require, it's a great game. If you're easily frustrated, you'll probably give up before you get terribly far. \n____________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeLp_OavtBM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeLp_OavtBM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeLp_OavtBM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeLp_OavtBM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Batman Returns (SMS) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1991 movie-license based platformer for the Sega Master System, Batman Returns. \n\nThis video shows two separate playthroughs of the game: the first shows all of the \"Route 1\" versions of each stage.
