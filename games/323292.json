Centuries of affordable housing, top-notch education programs, impecable care for communities and residents and a tax system that works are coming to an end!\n\nOn the fifteenth of New August 7839 A.S.K., the mining planet Delta XVI was engulfed by an unprecidented time paradox. Space Korea's top time researchers have concluded its destruction was purely accidental, but the public have other ideas and conspiracy theories are rampant among the universe. The people's republic of Centurion IX stage a mass protest against Space Korea's decision not to hold a public inquiry. Deaths are reported to be in their millions.\n\nNew November of 7840 A.S.K. brings further evidence to the table suggesting Space Korea have been keeping dangerous secrets. A green spec is spotted on the horizon of Gondala World and the planet loses sixteen days of its year. After leaked documents are obtained by the press, 3939th vice president of Space Korea Spiro T. Agnew II is executed, and the public are informed that Space Korea's long-term and extremely dangerous enemy, Quackers \"Fransisco\" Duckworth III is still alive and well, despite Space Korea's claims that he was eliminated twenty-four hundred years ago.\n\nIn the coming years Space Korea's millitary operations are stretched as planets once aligned with cause fight back, citing that the relationship is no longer profitable due to the decline of the Space Korean stock markets, induced by the untrustworthy government. Space Korea are forced outline severe expenditure cuts, and the millitary budget is the hardest hit. Unable to withstand civil unrest and the growing number of terrorists attacks throughout the universe, Space Korea are forced to retreat to their homeworld, abandoning decades of research and technological advancements.\n\nRelationships are torn and Space Korea find themselves ill-prepared for their primary objective - to eliminate Quackers. With limited defenses and a lack of support, they are unable to locate the duck and live under constant fear that very soon Quackers will find and destroy Space Korea for good.\n\nBUT QUACKERS WANTS A HOLIDAY\nDiscovering that he hasn't taken a break in thousands of years, Quackers Fransisco Duckworth III has set his sights on the long fabled \"Sunshine Superstar Island\". It's the right time of year for a perfect tan, and Sunshine Superstar Island is known for having numerous areas with the same summer/beach theme rather than being diverse and constantly interesting.\n\nBut Sunshine Superstar Island has its own problems - the place is a mess! The local populace have taken a neutral stance against Space Korea and Quackers and that isn't good enough! The island is covered in the filth of those who do not pledge a backing to Quackers' cause, and these people must be cleaned up. There'll be no dark clouds of indifference while Quackers is around!\n\nAND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN\nHe might be able to manipulate time and space but he can't control himself! You, the potentially attractive player must guide our hero through the depths of Sunshine Superstar Island, collecting power stars for an unspecified reason and using the planet as a weapon in the great time war that lies ahead. It'll be a bumpy ride and since all your friends are dead, a lonely one, but SHPDMBGWL4 Sunshine promises to deliever the greatest gameplay experience known to mankind.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shpdmbgwl4-sunshine"}
