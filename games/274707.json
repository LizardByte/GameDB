Unleaving guides players on an introspective journey rather than imposing its meaning. Just as art is often open to interpretation, Unleaving puts the experience in players' hands as they navigate puzzles with minimal direct storytelling.\nPlayers will explore a surreal world where every scene is a new painting, as if stepping into a living painting. With no repeated puzzles or paintings.\nUnleaving invites players to explore a dream-like world filled with metaphors, personal interpretation, and try by death mechanics.", "summary": "A child is tempted one last time by life's mystery and illusions to journey into a surreal world challenging ideas of everything and nothing", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/unleaving", "videos": [{"id": 122883, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "EtISiVftKY0"}]}
