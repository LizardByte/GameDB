What does this entity want, and how does it know who you are?\n\nHorizon Signal is a new and rich storyline written by Alexis Kennedy, a British writer best known for his work at Failbetter Games, which he co-founded. His writing for Sunless Sea and Fallen London has been widely acclaimed, and now he is scribing new stories for Stellaris.\n\nThis story update is a free DLC for Stellaris and highlights one of the great strengths of the game \u2013 its ability to tell stories that entertain and entrance without distracting you from the core strategic gameplay. The DLC consists of a somewhat rare event chain that can potentially be triggered at any time in your game. Even if you are playing a save that was started before installing Horizon Signal, the event chain can still occur in your game.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stellaris-horizon-signal", "videos": [{"id": 75254, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dADQERPfpek", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dADQERPfpek", "title": "Stellaris - Horizon Signal by Alexis Kennedy - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dADQERPfpek/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
