In the gameplay-side of thing, a rainbow-colored Donderful Combo Crown, which was only available in Donder Hiroba site, is now implemented in the arcade and is awarded to donders who full combo a song with all good hits.\n\nAlso, starting from this version, a new scoring system is introduced. There will be no \"Gogo-time bonus\", \"10000 bonus point for every 100 combos\" or \"bonus point for last hit of balloon notes\". The traditional scoring system and the Shin-uchi (\u771f\u6253) system will not be used anymore.\n\nUnlike past arcade version whereas failed to norma-clear the song (usually the first or the second song) will result in either instant game over or revival drum-rolling, the game will continue even if failed to norma-clear.\n\nThe Katsu medal shop has been removed starting from this version.\n\nAI Battle Performance mode, which was introduced in Green Version, has been removed temporarily and later re-introduced with Version 6.21 update for the Japanese release.\n\nStarting from this arcade, songs are appeared in more than one genre folder. The Children/Folk genre has been replaced by the newly-created Kids genre, which consists of songs that were formerly categorized under the Children/Folk genre as well as songs from other genres that were mainly children-focused. Also, name change from the J-pop to Pops, which is only on console releases since Drum Session!, has been applied to this arcade release as well. However, songs that were categorized under either Game Music genre or Variety gerne were merged into Game & Variety genre before it was separated into individual genres again in March 2021.\n\nFor Asia release, the Donder Hiroba site, which was previously exclusive to Japanese donders, is now made available for Asian donders, though it was only available in Japanese language at first when it launched due to time-constraint on developer's end.
