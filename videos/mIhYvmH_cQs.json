Because of that, I can actually record Danoni gameplay! Honestly, I'm really glad, I've always wanted to show off this game! \n\nIt actually is a browser game (Used to be a flash game, but now runs in HTML5 if I'm correct), so you don't actually have to download anything! All charts are user-made! \nI actually made my own chart before here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvrGI-bjwnM)\nIt's 11k though and not public, also I didn't know how to crop video back then so you'll have to squint your eyes a bit RIP (also I managed to pass that one already)\n\nOh yeah speaking of 11k, the main keymodes in this game are actually 5k, 7k, 7ik, 9k, 11k and 11lk! The letter next to the number (excluding k) actually represents a different key layout that you should use! For example, 7k and 7ik have the same number of keys, but the keys are arranged differently! 7k is standard 7k while 7ik is more like 3+4k! \n\nOf course, as you can see from this video, there are other keymodes that you can try, such as 15Ak, 15Bk, 17k, 23k, etc. If you don't see any keymode that you like, you can actually make a new one of your own! I haven't really figured out how to do that yet, but if I managed to learn how, I will create hell. In fact, you could actually have a chart that changes keymode during gameplay (called Trans key)! I might want to show that one next!\n\nTo find the charts, I usually look at these two websites:\nFor main keymodes - \nhttp://dodl4.g3.xrea.com/normal11/index.html \n\nFor pretty much any other keymodes - \nhttp://apoi108.sakura.ne.jp/danoni/ta/index.php?keys=All&order=ASC&HTML5=False \n\nPeople are actually posting scores on danoni pretty actively, I think! You can find them when you look at #danoni on Twitter! I've posted some of mine there already! You can click on the tweet button that you see on the result screen, and it'll prepare a tweet template for you! You can add some comments on the tweet, maybe add a screenshot with it, and then you just send tweet!\n\nI hope that you'll decide to try the game out yourselves! \n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nSong: Kankitsu - Breeze\nSong Source: BMS\nMaker: \u3059\u305a\u3081\nChart Link: https://suzume.kirara.st/breeze/?scoreId=0", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIhYvmH_cQs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIhYvmH_cQs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIhYvmH_cQs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIhYvmH_cQs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIhYvmH_cQs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[23k Danoni] Vibe Chart (Kankitsu - Breeze)", "description": "Ok yeah, you know how I recently learnt to crop videos like how you crop pictures now?
