Struggle to build a base and gear-up in the hostile environment. Defend yourself from wildlife and AI hunters (who also build bases in the world). Progress your base technology for advanced item crafting and upgrades.

You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend allowing some time before trying out the game. There are many YouTube game-plays showing the current state of game. I am the sole developer of the project, which I work on in my spare time as a passion project. I feel this is important to mention, so that those considering playing the game can make a more informed purchase decision.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2wXF28xf4g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2wXF28xf4g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2wXF28xf4g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2wXF28xf4g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2wXF28xf4g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Subsistence - Early Access Release Trailer", "description": "Steam store page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/418030/\n\nSubsistence is a sandbox, first person, open-world survival game.
