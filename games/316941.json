It replaces the 4th episode of The Ultimate Doom. Inspired by the works of John Romero on Sigil, it started out as a single maps contest emulating the mechanics of Sigil, but ended up evolving into a full episode community project. It has contributions from well known mappers such as Daniel (NeoDoom, Final NeoDoom) and Deadwing (Ozonia, Moonblood), just as newcomers like Sca, who has made his first map ever for this mod (and also one inspired in the hospital his first son was born, at that very day).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cramunhao-a-sigil-tribute"}
