{"id": "yMO-0TWQtTA", "snippet": {"title": "Deer Napped", "description": "Deer Napped is a 1995 Pie in the Sky engine-powered shooter by Nic-Ty Entertainments. Created by fourteen-year-olds Nick Fletcher and Tyler Smith as part of an entrepreneurship program, Deer Napped tasks players with rescuing Santa's eight reindeer from the Abominable Snowpeople and saving Christmas. The no-frills gameplay barely variates from Pie in the Sky standards, mostly using stock graphics and sound effects. The game is admirably put together considering it was made by a team of teenagers with possibly no other experience, but the homemade parts - some of the original graphics and voiceovers - are noticeably and expectedly shoddy. But that's the Pie in the Sky engine for you. Deer Napped aims to be kid-friendly, making weapons non-violently transform enemies into snowmen.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas everybody! I stopped recording before the third level, not realizing it was different and had a castle in it. Whoops. I think there's supposed to be music, at least on the title, but it didn't play for me.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMO-0TWQtTA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMO-0TWQtTA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMO-0TWQtTA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Deer Napped", "description": "Deer Napped is a 1995 Pie in the Sky engine-powered shooter by Nic-Ty Entertainments.
