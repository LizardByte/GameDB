It was published by Cryo Interactive (A definete reason why this game is so obsucre, since the publisher is extremely obscure, due to having released a number of nutoriously bad games, and not having their games included on PS1 demo discs as playable demos or trailer videos.) and was developed by Smart Dog. It was released only in PAL (As with most of Cryo's games) on July 7th, 1999, and is a racing game similar to WipEout and Mario Kart, where you use weapons to get ahead of your opponents, and also has Twisted Metal type deathmatch arenas. It has Arcade (The main focus), Tournament (2 Players only), Battle (2 players only) and Time Trial.\n\nIn Arcade, you have to come in the top three in the first three circuits per zone to advance to the deathmatch arena, and in deathmatch arenas, you have to get 10 frags before your opponents to advance to the next zone. Failure to do so, you have to keep trying over and over again until you do it. The game has 4 zones.\n\nThe game is extremely bad, it has horrible graphics, confusing track designs, jerky steering, cheap enemies (They use powerups instantly when they pick it up), and the absolute fact, that you can only save your game settings and records after a race. I absolutely DO NOT recommend it!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsBqhj5Zmpc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsBqhj5Zmpc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsBqhj5Zmpc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsBqhj5Zmpc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsBqhj5Zmpc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "PS1 - 360 Three Sixty - Part 1 - Water Zone", "description": "This is undoubtably, one of the worst WipEout clones ever made, as you will be able to see.
