It consists of three stages with different gameplay in each. The first one is a side-scrolling platform level with automatic running. Two buttons are used: one for swinging between rooftops and one for shooting a web at enemies standing in the way.\n\nIn the second stage, Spider-Man runs through a subway tunnel and has to avoid oncoming trains. It's possible to jump up to the ceiling to avoid the trains but it is necessary to jump back down to avoid hitting a barrier. The third and final stage is a battle against Doc Ock. He attacks with his mechanical arms which Spider-Man has to web up. Once all arms are webbed it is possible to capture the villain. Once all stages have been completed the game restarts at a higher difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
