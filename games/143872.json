All at once, a massive swarm of jellyfish overrun Bikini Bottom, and begin attacking Bikini Bottomites! Oh, the horror!\n\nIt's up to SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs to eradicate the Jellien invasion, and the resulting clones that follow. They'll have to stay one step ahead of the Overlord's advances in order to survive these weird, and rather horrifying, monstrosities that are on the prowl. They've fought robots, bucketheads, and more... surely they can take down some scary Jelliens, right? ...Right?\n\nSigh, better grab some mayo and get to it! I have a feeling tonight's going to be a very long night.", "summary": "Around the Clock at Bikini Bottom is a first-person low-poly survival horror parody based off of the hit TV series, \"SpongeBob SquarePants,\" and the returning wrath of the Jelliens.
