Instead of choosing the foes for the player, each stage gives the player a choice between two foes. For instance, the first stage gives you a choice between Anguirus and Rodan. Each battle is based around the movie it was based off of. For instance, Anguirus' stage has Godzilla appear as he did in 1955, uses Godzilla's roars from that film, and takes place at the Osaka Castle grounds. When the player completes a stage, they are rewarded with a certain amount of points. The better the player does in the stage (defeating the enemy in a short amount of time, the amount of health they have left, etc), the higher the score they will receive. When the player has gotten to Stage 6, they are once again told to pick their opponent, but this time, the player has up to six choices for their opponent, the number depending on score. The Super X II is always available, Mechagodzilla 2 is unlocked at 450,000 points, Biollante's Final Form is unlocked at 500,000 points, Mecha-King Ghidorah is unlocked at 550,000 points, Battra's Imago form is unlocked at 600,000 points, and Super Mechagodzilla is unlocked at 650,000 points.", "summary": "Godzilla: Battle Legends (simply referred to as \"Godzilla\" in North America) is a fighting game based on the Godzilla film franchise, made for the Turbo Duo in 1993, developed by Alfa System and published in the United States by Hudson Soft.\n\nWhen Godzilla fights a certain foe, his appearance changes to reflect the era when he battled in certain films. For example, Godzilla looks like as he did in 1955 when he fights Anguirus, and as in 1964 when he fights Rodan. This game's sequel, Godzilla: Monster War for the SNES, features fewer monsters, with the inclusion of Biollante as a playable character and Mothra.\n\nIn single player mode, only Godzilla is playable.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla-battle-legends", "videos": [{"id": 38208, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ADYNfpEkRh8"}]}
