Its deadly secret is that this device was in fact built to take out ground targets, for example any major city could be destroyed in seconds once the cannon is in position. \n \nYou are Sergeant Ash, an anti terrorist specialist. \n \nDuring training exercises in Africa you are suddenly recalled and flown to HQ for a top-secret briefing: \n \nWe are sorry to bring you in at such short notice Sergeant. Two days ago rebel forces took the Meteor complex by storm, they are our holding many of our troops captive. The situation has been in deadlock for some days now, we can't even get close without threats of mass destruction. We are considering these as very real threats even though we are not sure whether the rebels have the encrypted firing codes. \n \nWe need you to move in now, just be careful because there sill is plenty of fighting breaking out with the rebel forces, if they find out that we have sent someone inside the complex the situation could grow far more serious. \n \nIt is not your job to get involved with the fighting, your job is to simply carry out a number of key objectives that will feed you after you are inside. We need you to work on saving the Meteor complex while our troops attempt to hold firm. \n \nDon't let us down Sergeant, you are best we have got. \n \nGood luck.", "summary": "Meteor is a look down military shooter for Windows supporting single player, cooperative and head to head game modes over a LAN or across the Internet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
