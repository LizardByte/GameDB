The console is built suspiciously like the Wii, having wireless controllers that look similar to television remotes and that respond to movement. It retails at \u00a350 in the UK.\n\nThe Sega Zone is built off a similar console called the \"Zone 40\" (with 40 games) which in turn was built off the \"Zone Wireless Gaming Console\" (with 7 games). With the Sega Zone there are 50 built in games, 20 of which are Sega Mega Drive titles, 14 are \"arcade games\" and 16 are \"Interactive Sports games\" which make use of the motion control technology.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-zone"}
