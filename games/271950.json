You're given a Bumper in the bottom-right. Click on one of the Launchers surrounding the field to launch the Bumper into it. It'll first move in the direction launched, then bump into a wall or another Bumper and start moving in the direction on the Bumper itself. Match three of the same colour horizontally or vertically to clear them off.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This version also plugs into Archipelago Multiworld, so you can try a whole new challenge with your friends!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bumper-stickers-archipelago-edition"}
