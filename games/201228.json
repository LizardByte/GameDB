The game's protagonist travels between various parallel worlds in order to solve the mystery of his parents' disappearance. Although parallel worlds are not an unfamiliar concept in science fiction, the game uses concepts from physics, mathematics, philosophy, history and religion to construct a unique fictional universe. In particular, the A.D.M.S. or Auto Diverge Mapping System; which visually displays the branching parallel worlds/storylines as a tree, aids the player in navigation.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 68254, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "00-04Wp-uwg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00-04Wp-uwg", "title": "YU-NO Saturn ver Opening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/00-04Wp-uwg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
