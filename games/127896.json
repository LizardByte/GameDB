Currently it features the British Expeditionary Force and the German Empire as opposing factions; however new nations will be brought over time, such as France and Austria-Hungary. The mod focuses on a realistic and accurate representation of warfare in 1918 while keeping a balanced and enjoyable gameplay. \n \nExperience the great operations of the last year of the Great War as Germany breaks through the Western Front in the Spring Offensive; as the Entente, liberate France and Belgium in the Hundred Days offensive. Look forward to heavy artillery strikes and the infamous gas attacks. Trenches will provide vital cover for infantry while tanks will roll over the battlefield and instil fear into the enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 32573, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "IXELTQiQiJs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXELTQiQiJs", "title": "Company of Heroes the great war 1918: GAS!!!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IXELTQiQiJs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
