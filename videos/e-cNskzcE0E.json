The top number on the left is FPS.\n\nThe chunky rendering engine is optimised for the A500 as well, but some things aren't: the C2P could still be improved, and the overall map/visibility handling procedures have not been touched and take more time than they could have. I however see the A500 version more as a \"proof of concept\", it should be reasonably playable without floors and ceilings, but the whole game is optimised for and smoothly playable on the A1200.\n\nSee the A1200 video for more details and links: https://youtu.be/liLFG8tTwmA\nA3000 performance: https://youtu.be/6Q9w67AuJps", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e-cNskzcE0E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e-cNskzcE0E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e-cNskzcE0E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e-cNskzcE0E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e-cNskzcE0E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Citadel 1.3 Remonstered performance on Amiga 500", "description": "This is the latest Citadel 1.3 \"Remonstered\" version running on a real, unaccelerated Commodore Amiga 500 with Fast memory. \n\nThe gameplay capture is done off an Amiga monitor so not great quality, but I wanted to show how it runs on real HW (emulator timings are a bit different).
