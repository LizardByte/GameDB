This wind lays waste to the lands making the surface unlivable. Because of this, most of the inhabitants of this land live in canyons (besides those who travel between them in low-flying airships.)\n\nThe story is about a young hero, who teams up with a small gang of pirates, to defeat Thane, a man trying to become the Wind God. To defeat him, Abel, our hero, must become the hero of Zephyr by finding all the ancient pieces of his armor.\n\nThis takes him to many canyons, all housing unique environments, and dungeons, he must explore to find these magical relics. Each item grants him new abilities and gives him the strength to save the land.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zephyrs-pass", "videos": [{"id": 130311, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4Ta-5x-8ooo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ta-5x-8ooo", "title": "Zephyr's Pass - Game Boy Color Trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Ta-5x-8ooo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
