Traditionally animated and with 2D painted backgrounds as well as comprehensive voice acting it seeks to hark back to the days of classic adventure games made by LucasArts and similar companies. The main character Buzz has ended up with the Necromonicon against his wishes and on top of that has accidentally cursed his pet, the result being it can now talk. Neither find this situation agreeable and so they set out to remove the curse on Buzz's cat and try to get the dreaded tome to the person who was searching for it in the first place. Now, if only he hadn't been kidnapped...\n\nSo far we've been presented with a puzzle and no clear way to solve it or any reason to. Someone in Darkham must be able to help us with our unique problem, it's just a matter of finding them.
