It is based on MTV's animated series of the same name, and follows the title characters Beavis and Butt-Head as they attempt to find their torn-up GWAR concert tickets. The Super NES version was developed by Realtime Associates, the Game Gear version by NuFX, and the Genesis/Mega Drive version by Radical Entertainment, all which were published by Viacom New Media and released in 1994.\n\nThe Game Gear version is much more simplified compared to the 16-bit versions. There are 2 different endings as well, but the ending you get depends only on difficulty setting, rather than on in-game choices like in the SNES and Genesis versions.\n\nPlayed on Hard difficulty, with More remarks (default setting). I show both endings, and then the interactive game over screen.\n\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/566mXldbGg0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/566mXldbGg0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/566mXldbGg0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/566mXldbGg0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/566mXldbGg0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Gear Longplay [152] MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head (US)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nMTV's Beavis and Butt-Head is a video game for Sega Genesis, SNES, and Game Gear.
