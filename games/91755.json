The game has yet to be announced elsewhere in the world. The game is a spiritual successor to Lost Magic on the Nintendo DS, and has similar gameplay, though is not a sequel. In the game the player will use the Wii Remote to cast spells by drawing a certain pattern. In all there are over 100 spells that you can execute. As in most games of this type (such as Lost Magic and Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings), you'll be given a map of the overworld before each battle so you can make a plan. Once you enter a battle, you'll be able to choose four characters to fight alongside your main character. The status of your partner is indicated by their icon's facial expression.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
