Apparently, it\u2019s a lost NES port of the old PROTO DERE arcade game which was showcased in 2017 for the AppSir launch party. I couldn\u2019t find information about the game in any of the listings. It\u2019s either an obsure bootleg, or a pre-production cart that never made it to release. Despite the internal damage on the game\u2019s circuit board, I was able to rip the ROM so you guys can have a look at it. It\u2019s filled with glitches, but I\u2019m certain I didn\u2019t corrupt the ROM. That\u2019s how it played when I got it working on my dusty old NES, so maybe that\u2019s why it was never released.\u201d", "summary": "The creation of the ancient Proto Dere .Nes led to AppSir's modern day hits Dere .Exe and Dere Evil .Exe.
