In a covert mining and research facility, tucked away in an undisclosed location, a ground-breaking discovery unfolded, a metallic bacteria capable of melding seamlessly with both organic matter and metals.\n\nDriven by the desperation of governments and militaries, they experimented with combining the metallic bacteria with human DNA. Creating the ultimate soldier, the Blood Engine. However, the experimental bacteria proved unpredictable, mutating uncontrollably and giving rise to an epidemic of mindless biomechanical cyborgs known as The Red Swarm.\n\nEmbark on an adrenaline-fueled journey as a Blood Engine soldier, activated by a science engineer, moments before he was killed. The player awakens to find themselves trapped in a military mining and research facility, now infested with The Red Swarm. The entire complex is encased in an impenetrable electrified dome sealing you, survivors, and the Red Swarm within.\n\nNavigate the treacherous terrain of the infected complex, battling through hordes of biomechanical adversaries, rescuing survivors, and restoring power and control. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as you strive to eliminate the threat before it spills beyond the confines of the facility.\n\nBlood Engine immerses you in an intense and challenging third-person open-world experience, delivering thrills and suspense as you race against time to thwart a global catastrophe. Will you emerge victorious against the relentless Red Swarm, or succumb to the biomechanical onslaught? The fate of humanity rests in your hands.", "summary": "Blood Engine: Immerse yourself in an action-packed third-person open-world experience. Race against time to thwart the relentless Red Swarm.
