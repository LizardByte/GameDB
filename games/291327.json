But that doesn't mean that they don\u2019t hold their own dangers; such as the villain of the red Net-Cube: Cracksom Virus. This dominant virus is putting all Net-Cubes in danger of being permanently deleted, so he can expand his empire of computing corruption to the real world, abandoned by humans.\n\nMeanwhile, a messaging algorithm called E-Mailer arrives at the world of Bloxland Qubitown, Randy and Manilla\u2019s home, giving them an urgent warning: the entire cyber-universe is in grave danger of being destroyed by Cracksom. He knows that they are the only ones who can stop his great threat. Moreover, according to the mayor Blue Quant\u00e1ramo, our heroes hold a hidden programming and power that prevents them from being corrupted by Cracksom himself. And so, they accept the mission to embark on a great adventure through all the different Net-Cubes. E-Mailer will also come along and open portals so our heroes can access the new worlds.", "summary": "Randy & Manilla is a game in which we discover a mysterious quantum cyber-universe hosted by Net-Cubes that contain virtual worlds with several game genres.\n\nIn gameplay terms, Each Net-Cube is a world, which contains levels that represent each video game genre.
