It was released for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1989. In this game, the player controls a ball, trying to get it to the exit by bouncing it off walls and various types of platforms. Loriciels wanted a 16-bit game so they handed it over to Infogrames who made Pop-up in 1991. The loading screen and graphics changed but the music sound effects and gameplay remained the same.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 5149, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ez7UtwRa7Ig"}, {"id": 5150, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Pqv9aigye6U"}]}
