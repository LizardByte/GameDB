There isn\u2019t much; as it often happens you\u2019re going to have to figure out a lot once you get boots on the ground. Your past successes in less-than-ideal situations like this were a big reason you were chosen for this assignment.\n\nThe Client:\n\nSally Franklin is a lifelong resident of Anteform Valley. She contacted our agency after her long term boyfriend Steve Johanson disappeared while supposedly running a short errand. She lives in the main village there and she should be one of the first ones you try to contact.\n\nShe\u2019s a close friend of the mayor of Anteform Valley, Bess Whitley, who apparently went to college with the Boss. Bess and the Boss. So yeah, no extra pressure.\n\nThe Missing People:\n\nSteve Johanson moved to Anteform Valley four years ago to take a job at their local radio station KLLR. According to Sally, he met her shortly after moving in and they hit it off almost immediately. She claims they weren\u2019t fighting and that he was in positive spirits \u2013 she claims she\u2019d know if he were planning on taking off and she vehemently rejects the idea that he committed suicide.\n\nWe just got word that Steve isn\u2019t the only missing person in Anteform Valley, just the first. Since then a young woman named Mary Wainwright has also mysteriously vanished. We don\u2019t know much about her yet, just that she also lived in the village and was off hiking somewhere and didn\u2019t come back. Obviously the two of them arranging a joint disappearance isn\u2019t out of the question. It\u2019s something for you to follow up on.", "summary": "Steve Johanson has disappeared and his girlfriend Sally Franklin has hired your detective agency to locate him. Even before you get on the scene there are signs that maybe this isn't just a simple missing persons case. Can you crack it? Explore Anteform Valley and its settlements, talk to its residents, search desks and files, and build up your skills as you collect clues to figure out what really happened to Steve and maybe even prevent it from happening again.\n\nAnteform is a horror / sci-fi detective story RPG in the style of the older Ultima games (Ultima I, Ultima II, Ultima III, Ultima IV, & Ultima V) as played on the Commodore 64 and 128 computers (although thematically it fits in better with the Worlds of Ultima games). Just like the original Ultima games, it includes a world view, enterable towns, and 3D dungeon displays. More importantly, it is a fully playable (and winnable) game with its own backstory, plot, setting, and characters.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anteform", "videos": [{"id": 74010, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "BoEIxjgoock", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEIxjgoock", "title": "Starting a game of Anteform", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BoEIxjgoock/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8194, "name": "Minima"}]}
