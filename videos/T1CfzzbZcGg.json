Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. \n\nThe game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including \"Thrash94Gaming\" you might know him for never being in a movie. \"LaraCroft86\" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least \"Gamer Jeffro\" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly that also were never in anything noteworthy.\n\nYou might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact.\n\nNow back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do.\n\nThis game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit.\n\nThe game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game.\n\nEither way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars! Use them to show all your friends that you are indeed the best gamer of the gamers.\n\nNow back to the fact that I have a gun. (Reference to the title of the game, get it? Lol)\n\nDon't worry, I won't use it.\n\nJust remember that I could.\n\nThank you.\"\n\n- Sheesh-Man 2023\n\nThis is the story trailer for Kimulator's Films newest game \"Buy The Game, I Have a Gun\" -Sheesh-man", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T1CfzzbZcGg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T1CfzzbZcGg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T1CfzzbZcGg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T1CfzzbZcGg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "\"Buy The Game, I Have a Gun\" -Sheesh-Man - Official Story Trailer 2023 | PS4", "description": "The game is releasing the 29th of  January 2023\n\n\"Listen carefully, this might be the most important thing you will ever buy in your entire life. \n\nThis game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why?
