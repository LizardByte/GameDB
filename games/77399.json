Crazy Climber 2000 takes the game play of the original and gives it a sweeping graphical makeover.\n\nThe object is again to scale buildings while avoiding the falling objects thrown at you by its tenants, as well as windows that close on your fingers. The buildings themselves are laid out differently In the first stages, for example, the buildings start out as square skyscrapers. Later levels, however, require you to scale round ones. As well as this, new threats are introduced, such as:\n\n- Circling vultures that throw eggs at you.\n- Gorillas reaching out to grab you on both sides of the building.\n- Window cleaners that go from left to right, making you fall if you get in their way\n- Boulders thrown from elevators\n\nCC2000 also allows you to move from one face of the building to another. Also included is the original game, in all its early 80s glory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-climber-2000", "videos": [{"id": 137179, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "j_8JjRF2Gzk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_8JjRF2Gzk", "title": "CrazyClimber 2000\u3000\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30de\u30fc2000", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j_8JjRF2Gzk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
