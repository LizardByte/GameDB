The game is targeted toward teenagers.\n\nYour objective is to go around asking people, look up in the official registry, and so on in order to complete your article for the day and thereby completing the mission. Every mission will get more difficult as you complete more of them, but will become easier if you don't manage to complete it that day.\n\nIn order to ask people questions you have to answer their question first, challenging the player to all sorts of topics and facts. When you think you have sufficient information, you will go in to your boss' office and he will ask relevant questions before completing the article. If any of the answers are wrong, you have to wait a few hours to try again but the mission fails as soon as the next day hits at 12 AM.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 63212, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "scS-BxTR6QQ"}]}
