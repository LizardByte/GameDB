All of the games can be started from one application, so you can jump between playing The First Encounter level to a Serious Sam 3 level and back without exiting the game. When listing game servers, servers playing TFE, TSE, SS3 \u2013 will all appear in the same list and you can vote map across games if you want. Oh, and owners of our VR games are able to play multiplayer together with their \"flat\" counterparts! \nSince there are so many changes and exciting new features, we'll just go ahead a list them here as bullet points. \n \nCool new features in Serious Sam Fusion 2017: \n \n- All games now support SteamOS/Linux/OSX! \n- Split-screen! \n- 64bit executables \n- Support for Vulkan API (DirectX9 is now being removed) \n- Multithreaded rendering \n- The new \"light-weight\" savegame system - savegames are now saved much faster, are very small and stored in the Steam cloud, and savegames still work even if a level is changed in a patch, or if a mod is updated \n- Full support for all controllers including Steam controller, PS4 gamepads, all older DInput joysticks \n- Proper multimonitor support \n- Borderless window support \n- Customizable sound outputs \n- Proper 3D audio using a proprietary sound-mixer (the same approach as used in the old Classic games) \n- Improved physics engine with better handling of character movement \n- Texture streaming in all games \n- Much better modding support with customizable weapons and items, improved scripting (including better support for scripting networked games) \n- Lots of other improvements, optimizations and fixes", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
