Pilot Style was given away as a promotional item at a game show in Japan and went relatively unnoticed. It only takes about an hour to complete, but it is an interesting tidbit in the King's Field world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kings-field-pilot-style"}
