As the player, you navigate the story as the spirit, an entity summoned by a community of witches who are in the middle of handing out judgement, which they leave up to you to decide. Having no memories of the world of the living, you must gather as much information as possible before making your decision. The witches themselves cannot see or hear you \u2014 for those who are not given the responsibility of speaking with spirits cannot approach them. DON\u2019T WAKE THE NIGHT is a collection of honest conversations between individuals belonging to the same community, and the heartache that comes with doubt and brewing tensions.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 27767, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jwd1-WhfCDg"}]}
