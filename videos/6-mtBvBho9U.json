Soon, you\u2019ll be able to manage your merry band of mercenaries on the go!\n\n---\nBattle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?\n\nThe game consists of a strategic world-map and a tactical combat layer. On the world-map you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.\n\n---\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/3aHUJXD\u200b\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ukiyopublish...\u200b\nLike OverHype on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/overhypestud...\u200b\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/UkiyoPublishing\u200b\nFollow OverHype on Twitter: https://twitter.com/OverhypeStudios", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-mtBvBho9U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-mtBvBho9U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-mtBvBho9U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-mtBvBho9U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-mtBvBho9U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Battle Brothers Launching 11th March Pre-Order Now!", "description": "UKIYO Publishing and Overhype Studios are proud to announce that the critically acclaimed procedurally-generated tactical RPG  Battle Brothers is coming to Nintendo Switch on March 11th with a 15% off Pre-Order discount on all content!
