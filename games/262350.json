Bulu Monster allows the user to become a monster trainer on Bulu Island. Sigma Game believes this app will stand out from all of the other monster games on the market as Bulu Monster puts the user fully in control. In this role playing adventure game, the user must discover, capture, fight and train one of the 150 monsters. Bulu Monster also allows the user to engage with friends and with other trainers online, enabling them to challenge their friends and other players of the game.\nBulu Monster was some eighteen months in the making; Sigma Game has ensured that the app is of the quality that users will have come to expect. The high quality animation, adventurous storyline, and the ability to challenge both friends and other users online adds to the exhilarating, high energy feel of this game.\nBulu Monster leads the user on a unique adventure that is not available on other monster games. As well as enabling the user to capture monsters, the user can train them, too, and this is what makes Bulu Monster different to the other games that can be found out there.\nFor ease of play, Bulu Monster has a one-hand touch control so no joystick is required, and it allows the user to be able to create the right balance between control and game playing. Another feature of Bulu Monster is the online shop. The shop allows users of Bulu Monster to access special purchase items and discounts as well as reading feedback from on other users and engaging with other competitors on the online forum.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bulu-monster"}
