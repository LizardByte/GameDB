You get 3 tries or 5 tries (through dipswitch setting) by knocking down as many bricks down as possible by deflecting or rebounding against the wall of the sledge hammer. Points are 1 point for yellow, 3 for the green, 7 for red. To make the game more challenging, the speed of the game increases after 4 hits and again at 12 hits and to the highest speeds in orange and red rows. The hammer decreases by half the size when the red row is broken through. \n\nA port of the arcade original", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tT70Tv6D41o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tT70Tv6D41o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tT70Tv6D41o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tT70Tv6D41o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tT70Tv6D41o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari 2600 Game: Breakout (Aka Breakaway IV) 1978 (Atari)", "description": "This early Breakout game has 2 rows of bricks and two rows of different colors.
