It was announced at the ChinaJoy 2016 expo, but with no further updates, the game entered vaporware status, having never been officially cancelled.\n\nThe protagonist would have been a pirate during the Golden Age of Piracy in the Caribbean, exploring its notable cities like Havana and Nassau while encountering side characters from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. In addition to naval battles, the game would feature PvE and PvP modes. The protagonist would be the last surviving member of a Mayan family on a quest for revenge. Said protagonist would go on to find relatives in the Caribbean Sea and find out the truth behind their family's massacre.\n\nAn open beta was due to release exclusively in China in March 2017. During its time in development, a Western release of the game was being considered. In July of that year, it was revealed that the open beta was never released and instead was allegedly pushed to 2018. Since then, there have been no updates on the game's status.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/assassins-creed-bloodsail", "videos": [{"id": 20933, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mhfEo-IurQI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhfEo-IurQI", "title": "Assassin's Creed Bloodsail - China Joy (2016) Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mhfEo-IurQI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 18, "name": "Assassin's Creed"}]}
