You play as the titular Rodent, a small rat that gains incredible power when he unwittingly comes into contact with sentient piece of cosmic driftwood. Not long after this chance meeting Rodent finds himself up against the mysterious Knights of the Round. Who are they? And what could they possibly want with Plank?\n\nFeatures\n - Players can choose from one of 4 starting weapon types. Each weapon type can be combined with any other in order to create a massive arsenal of incredibly deadly weaponry.\n - Each level takes on a life of its own: one minute you're platforming, and the next you're piloting a submarine while being chased by a laser wielding shark.\n - All of the art in the game is drawn by hand which gives it a story book quality (despite the fact that there\u2019s exploding teddy bears everywhere.)\n - Rodent and Plank\u2019s music has a unique flare to it that we lovingly refer to as \"techno organic\"; it's like Dave Wise had a baby with the techno Viking.\n - Rodent and Plank is a difficult game; but like the games we've drawn inspiration from it's been finely tuned and balanced for maximum replay-ability.\n\n\nTo be available on Steam in 2020.
