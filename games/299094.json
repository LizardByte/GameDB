The Double-Barrel Flintlock Pistol, as the name suggests, can fire two bullets in either rapid succession or both at the same time. It is said to be designed for more close-range combat. Throwing Knives, meanwhile, are very versatile as they have three ways to attack. You can either use them to do a melee stab, which can be charged or uncharged, as well as for a range-throwing attack.\n\nSea of Thieves Season 12 is confirmed to add several new tools to the game, so here is the list of everything that will be added:\n\n- Scattershot: A new type of ammunition that fires four small cannonballs in a short range but widespread.\n- Bone Caller: A new throwable that can spawn three skeletons that\u2019ll aid you in battle.\n- Wind Caller: A shell that can, as the name suggests, call wind. It can be used to speed your ships, blow the timber out of your foes, prevent fall damage, and so much more.\n\nBesides these tools, there will be two neat QoL additions:\n- Ziplines: New ziplines will be added across the map.\n- Harpoon line travel: The rope that you create with your harpoon can now be walked, but beware, you\u2019ll have to balance or you\u2019ll fall off.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sea-of-thieves-season-12", "videos": [{"id": 112255, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "nN7Q-xEraWU"}]}
