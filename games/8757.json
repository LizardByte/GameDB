While cop drones circle overhead, you\u2019ll be sticking to the alleyways with a variety of weapons and plantabl explosives, finding new and unique ways to get away with murder most foul.\n\nBut one single slip-up will cost you. There are no respawns here \u2013 when you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s it. Duck and weave through the claustrophobic streets as a living city does its best to stop you breathing \u2013 permanently.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}]}
