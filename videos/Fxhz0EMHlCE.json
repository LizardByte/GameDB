{"id": "Fxhz0EMHlCE", "snippet": {"title": "OnlineCTR - The PS1 Crash Team Racing Online Experience (Launch Trailer)", "description": "OnlineCTR is finally playable after 5 years of research and development. Made possible by the entire modding + decompile team, plus some bonus network engineers, plus 100+ beta testers, plus volunteer server hosts!\n\nThis mod will be playable via DuckStation emulator for the next few years, until eventually replacing DuckStation with a completed PC Port (73% rewritten so far).\n\nMost recent contributions made by Niko, Tezca, Pampa, PedroHLC, Faradise, Claud, and Matt(psio).\n\nOnlineCTR Website (may take a few seconds to load, still WIP):\nhttps://www.online-ctr.com\n\nOnlineCTR Discord Server (with download, lobby chats, and install directions):\nhttps://discord.gg/ZWaZhmzqJ5\n\nThis project is the #1 longest running mod in the entire history of CTR modding. It is actually the \"first\" mod that started it all, the original source of inspiration for the decompile, starting back in our Cheat Engine days before the decompile even started.\n\nAll footage in this trailer comes from a worldwide network, with each player in a completely different country, and yet there is almost no lag. With private server hosting, we do support LAN connections, for the ultimate CTR multiplayer experience.\n\nIf someone has 8 monitors and a crazy GPU, we also support localhost connection, so 8 DuckStation instances can play multiplayer on one computer, for pure-zero lag.\n\nThis is just the initial public release, meaning that many updates and features are coming in the future. Join the OnlineCTR Discord to play.\n\nHave fun! Stay tuned for more.\n\nMusic:\nPolar Pass 8-Bit Remix by carlospazuzu\nPolar Pass Remix by aRBee", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxhz0EMHlCE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxhz0EMHlCE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxhz0EMHlCE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxhz0EMHlCE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxhz0EMHlCE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "OnlineCTR - The PS1 Crash Team Racing Online Experience (Launch Trailer)", "description": "OnlineCTR is finally playable after 5 years of research and development.
