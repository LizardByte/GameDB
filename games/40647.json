It is a version of the zero-player cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. Video Life was only available through a special mail order offer to owners of CommaVid's Magicard, which itself is considered to be one of the rarest Atari 2600 cartridges ever released. According to original CommaVid co-owner Irwin Gaines, only 20 cartridges or less of Video Life were ever made. Editors of AtariAge estimate approximately 500 cartridges were produced. A report in the Chicago Reader by Jeffrey Felshman estimates that cartridges would sell for as much $3000 at the time.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/video-life", "videos": [{"id": 27023, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "gqSwlcb-NgU"}]}
