Twins Jennie and Tom were having a pleasant frolic through the forest, until they came across a strange, unknown path... and were ambushed by a pair of goblins. The two mischievous creatures won't tolerate any twins in the forest other than themselves, so they hatch a wicked plan to separate the children. Here, the player takes control of one of the siblings (either Tom or Jennie) as the other is abducted by the goblins.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twins-in-trouble"}
