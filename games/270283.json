That was until the Skystone shattered, spreading noxious Haze across the land and leaving foul Mimic creatures in its wake. The survivors took refuge in a floating city in the sky while the land below was consumed, and remained there for 200 years. Today, the three factions united to return to the Ground, exterminate the Mimics, and reclaim the land.", "summary": "Remnants of Skystone was a 2D side-scrolling platformer in a steampunk post-apocalyptic setting with multiplayer elements. Players could play as one of the three playable classes (Aeronaut, Crag or Ferric), each with different abilities, and travel to different parts of Nidaria or Etherea. Missions and Quests were the main single-player elements and Trailblazing was the main multiplayer element.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/remnants-of-skystone", "videos": [{"id": 99086, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wyz1cOkbQoQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyz1cOkbQoQ", "title": "Remnants of Skystone Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
