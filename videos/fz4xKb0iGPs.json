Lovecraft and weird shows like Twin Peaks.\n\nYou play as a man who finds himself lost in a dark street somewhere in the city of New Wenders. It doesn\u2019t take long before you start having flashbacks and regaining your memory. Something terrible happened, and you were part of it. This event somehow opened your eyes to a whole new world that has been hiding beneath the shadows.\n\nWritten by Robson A. Siebel\nArt by Alberto R.
