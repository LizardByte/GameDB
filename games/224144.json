Winners get loot and territories, while losers get to keep their life. Maybe.\nMoving bots into a battle is no easy task. You need a ship or even a navy. With crews and captains.\nPlanetary alliances and governments issue orders to their armed forces and mercenaries.\nIn the midst, traders, looters, and all other sorts of folks are making all different kinds of living.\nThe Player's primary objective is to expand their available resources.\nStarting with your wits and modest funds you\u2019ll have to scrap yourself a bot bodyguard squad, perhaps, a ship.\nFrom there on \u2013 you\u2019re free to travel the stars, earn your keep and become the force that shapes this sector.\nHistory, and law, are written by the victor. It\u2019ll do you well to remember that.", "summary": "Cryptobots was the first play to earn game of its type in 2017, and we\u2019ve been successfully operating it ever since.
