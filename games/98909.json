Each \"floor\" of the tower has an EXP total that the player must reach in order to advance. If the player defeats all of a floor's opponents without meeting the goal, one final opponent will appear. If, after defeating this extra opponent, the player still fails to meet the goal, Arle is booted from the tower and the game ends. The EXP goals vary from version to version; for example, Super Puyo Puyo Tsu requires twice as many points to clear the first floor as the arcade or Mega Drive versions.", "summary": "Puyo Puyo Tsuu Perfect Set is an upgrade of Puyo Puyo Tsuu.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-ages-2500-vol-12-puyo-puyo-tsuu-perfect-set", "videos": [{"id": 89899, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ln1OZZP3swE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln1OZZP3swE", "title": "Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 12: Puyo Puyo Tsuu Perfect Set (PS2 Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ln1OZZP3swE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
