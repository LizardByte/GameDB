So, we decided not to take any risks which could disrupt the release.\n\nThese past two days have been emotionally tough for our team since we envisioned the release very differently \u2014 with a cozy stream dedicated to the long-awaited launch of the mod. But none of that matters anymore.\n\nThe most important thing now is that we released the project on the promised date.

However, over the past two days, we have completely rebuilt the project, and it is now available as a standalone \"installation-ready package\". Just download, install, and play.
