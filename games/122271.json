That fateful night was August 9, 1793. \n \nOver 200 years later, all the stolen works of art have since been found by authorities and returned to their current museums and galleries. The once-noble and grand ch\u00e2teau held the group of thieves within its dungeon. Now, the castle has been abandoned as the spirits of those thieves roam the halls. \n \nYour task is to enter the ch\u00e2teau, build up your bank account, and collect all the works of art that originally adorned the castle walls for a special art exhibition. Learn about all the artworks and artists in order to become the ultimate Art Historian.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hall-of-the-art-thieves"}
