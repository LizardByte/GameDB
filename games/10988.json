Lovecraft and classic horror. Rendered in a distinct visual style that blends pixel art with paper and ink textures, They Bleed Pixels is a singular mix of intense platforming and fierce beat-em-up action. At the core of its fighting system is a simple one-button combat scheme with surprising depth and versatility. Button mashing is discouraged while kicking shadowy monsters into saws, pits and spikes is rewarded, thanks to a unique system that lets you earn and place your own checkpoints through stylish kills. The fancier your kills, the faster you fill the checkpoint meter.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/they-bleed-pixels", "videos": [{"id": 43235, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "7X42GIOfuYo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X42GIOfuYo", "title": "They Bleed Pixels Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7X42GIOfuYo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43234, "name": "Nintendo Switch Launch Trailer", "video_id": "9UdEKTZlAj0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UdEKTZlAj0", "title": "They Bleed Pixels - Coming to Nintendo Switch\u2122 Oct 22, 2020 - Pre-Order Now!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9UdEKTZlAj0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
