The game allows movement in three dimensions, but most of the platforming sequences in the five stages are structured like in a 2D game. A few sequences focus on walking into or out of the depth of the screen in a mostly straight progression, usually running away from enemy vehicles. Enemies have a yellow ring around them on the floor, and the hero can only whack them with his mallet as long as he is standing outside of the ring.\n\nThe official homepage saw the game scheduled for July 2002, but somehow the game didn't come out before Candy Global Media published it in 2004, when retail PC games in Korea were all but dead and gone, and even DDS itself would have been near their end, if they still existed at all. Needless to say, the Xbox version that was also planned remained a pipe dream like all other Digital Dream Studios games for the console.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mangchi-the-hammer-boy", "videos": [{"id": 85325, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HZVlo5cmhZw"}]}
