Aniwar is both an entertaining game and a social network that links people; it is a platform for everyone to develop a sustainable community that contributes to the ecosystem.\nThe Blockchain economic concept used to compensate our participants for their contributions to the ecosystem distinguishes Aniwar from traditional games. This new gaming concept is referred to as \"play for earning money.\" Thousands of players from impoverished nations have joined Aniwar in search of a new source of income during the Covid pandemic. Aniwar participants of different genders, ages, and occupations can become good players, even if they have never been exposed to Blockchain technology.", "summary": "Aniwar is a universe inspired by adorable creatures where everyone may earn tokens via skilled gameplay and ecological contributions.
