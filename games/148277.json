The gulf between the once-distant realms of Parthoris and Cronos has all but disappeared as dark portals continue to open across your homeland, and vast hordes of the undead and their cohorts from beyond Hell's Maw spill forth, slaughtering mercilessly in their bid to find you and exact their vengeance upon the Faithless One.\n\nYou have already brought ruin to the first major guardian in your way - the fearsome Iron Sentinel and its army of liches - but this has enraged your pursuers further. You now face the treacherous labyrinthine grounds of the Iron Fortress - a sprawling breeding ground for unholy knights, malevolent magicians, and terrifying beasts pulled from the underworld's deepest recesses. This vast mountaintop fort is steeped in a dark aura of demonic possession that now reaches far across the realm, corrupting the earth and its citizens beneath. Beyond this foul structure, who even knows what lies.\n\nQuestions flood your mind as you enter its unholy gates - who or what is the soulless evil opening these portals? And why do you feel a cold sense of dread, as if someone may be watching you from the shadows? Perhaps an old foe? Or a new evil from some other realm? Could it somehow be both...?", "summary": "The hellish minions left to wander in the aftermath of Korax's defeat during the battle of Cronos have now scattered across Parthoris looking for fresh meat, and a new realm to call their own. Beings of chaos roam freely, causing disarray in the realm. The citizens of Parthoris have barely had time to rebuild their lives in the wake of D'Sparil's reign of chaos, which was put to an end by a yet-unidentified outsider.\n\nYou are Corvus. You have laid low for a while in the dockside town of Port Mercy, and become aware of the situation almost immediately. Portals open in every corner of the town, legions of the damned pouring forth and slaughtering the populace. Stepping out into the pouring rain, you come to a scene of fresh blood dashed against the cobbles, deep red tendrils of it snaking into the gutters, and raging monsters bellowing vicious cries of revenge as the townsfolk meet a gruesome end.\n\nThey smell your blood and close in on you. Standing at the foot of the belltower, you brandish your elvenwand and confront the desperate beasts as they converge upon you. The gleam of its topaz gem sends chills of fear down their backs.\n\nIt's you - the faithless one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/faithless-trilogy"}
