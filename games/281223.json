Each team is represented by a group of four footballers (less than the 11 for real-life soccer) scattered around the field. The two teams are differently coloured: white and blue. The nearest player to the ball from each team is highlighted as yellow or black, and you can only control this player. Game play involves collecting the ball with your player, dribbling it towards the goal at your end of the field (or preventing your opponent from doing the same) and then kicking the ball into the net.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-soccer", "videos": [{"id": 111720, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HOzvmyMwPr4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOzvmyMwPr4", "title": "3D Soccer - Arcadia 2001 Emerson Radio - emulador Emulator2001", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzvmyMwPr4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
