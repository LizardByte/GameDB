The game utilizes the same engine as its predecessor, X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy, and was also launched for the Master System in Brazil by Tec Toy.\n\nSet in a dystopian future, Mojo hosts a deadly TV show where participants engage in fights to the death. Having imprisoned certain X-Men from the past, Mojo aims to recreate their most epic battles. Wolverine and Rogue must enter the game, rescue their friends, and ultimately defeat Mojo to return home.\n\nPlayers start by choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. As each new level is conquered, additional X-Men become available, starting with Gambit, followed by Cyclops, Havok, and finally Shard. If any X-Men perish, the player must restart the level, selecting from the remaining characters. When all X-Men are defeated, the game concludes.\n\nEach character can activate their unique power at will. Wolverine employs his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit hurls explosive cards, Cyclops unleashes optic blasts, Havok fires plasma blasts, and Shard utilizes energy blasts. Characters have both an energy meter and a power meter, depleting when they take hits or use their powers. Energy and power-restoring items can be found throughout the game.\n\nThe gameplay primarily revolves around navigating through six levels, with each level culminating in a boss battle against well-known comic characters such as Magneto, Fitzroy, a Sentinel, and others.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-mojo-world", "collections": [{"id": 4340, "name": "X-Men"}]}
