As The Persistence is pulled into the gravity of the collapsing star, the ship's computer, 'IRIS' wakes remaining members of the crew from cryogenic sleep - one at a time. Can you stay alive long enough to save The Persistence?\"", "summary": "\"The Persistence is First Person Stealth Horror exclusively for PS4 & PSVR.\n\nThe Persistence is procedurally generated. Every time you die and a new character is awoken by IRIS, the layout of the ship has changed. Every life will play out differently, with different enemies to face, items to find and power-ups to collect.\n\nSurvival requires you to be stealthy and VR is the perfect match for this. Sneaking around and hiding behind cover; it's second nature in VR to just lean round or peek over cover to gain the advantage Your friends can also help out by connecting to the game with their phone or tablet and hacking into the ship's computer. Once in the ship's system, players get to control doors, freeze or distract enemies, disable traps and find hidden items to scavenge for the VR player. Be aware though, sometimes the tablet player gets rewarded if you die, do you trust your friends?\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-persistence", "videos": [{"id": 14472, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "efQ_a2fR8rU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efQ_a2fR8rU", "title": "The Persistence Trailer | PSVR Stealth Horror Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efQ_a2fR8rU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14471, "name": "E3 2017 preview video", "video_id": "x4eQzv4sQW0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4eQzv4sQW0", "title": "The Persistence - PS VR Preview | E3 2017", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4eQzv4sQW0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
