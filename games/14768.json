Such actions include: Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.\n\nAll kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.\n\nMultiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d-day"}
