Was she present the previous night too?\n\nAnd so begins your journey\u2026 or, to be more precise, your epic hangover.", "summary": "Link lost everything: memory, her equipment, and even worse, Princess Zelda. It's up to you to help him overcome this terrible ordeal! It is a complete game, which will make you laugh (hopefully) from beginning to end.

Fortunately, the Forcetri is with you!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-mystery-of-solarus-xd"}
