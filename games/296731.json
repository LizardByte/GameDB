A pseudo-3D 2D battle race that aims to complete all 10 stages between Paris and Butard!\n\nMake full use of jumps and turbos to step on enemies, climb over cliffs, and defeat unique bosses to win!\n\nAlso, it is compatible with red and blue 3-D glasses, and you can see it in 3D by pressing the select button. You can play by switching to 3D mode. Please bring your own glasses.\n\nWhat is Pico Pi Collection?\nThis is a new 8-bit style game series that allows you to enjoy a nostalgic and fresh game with a 4-color dot character, single-note BGM, etc.\n\nThis work is presented as a game version of a bad but funny comedy manga from the bubble era.\n\nThis game is based on the original author's strong wishes and is made to be enjoyed (and tormented) by the unnecessarily long storyline.\n\n*Please note when playing in 3-D mode: This game is visually stimulating, so if you feel unwell, please avoid playing. Also, please do not play for long periods of time and take sufficient breaks while playing.\n\nOther Pico Pi Collection games are currently being distributed, so be sure to check them out!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tondemo-nishibuuki-2-paris-boutard-rally"}
