It is a 2D action game with both space ship and on-foot segments. Had it been released, ResQ would have been an exclusive title for the Mega Drive.\n\nPsygnosis cancelled ResQ very close to release for unknown reasons. It was reportedly programmed on 486 DOS PCs, with the artwork produced with Deluxe Paint II and III on Amiga 1200s. A prototype has since been unearthed, with an internal copyright date of 1993.\n\nNotably, ResQ's bonus stages are depicted as third-person on-the-rails shooting segments which involve primitive 3D polyons, similar to the Super Nintendo's Star Fox.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
