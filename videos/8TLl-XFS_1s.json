I know there's already a game sample video which went through like 2 stages somewhere, but I'm gonna reupload the whole game, stage-by-stage, with different characters for each stage.\n\nHere's the download link for the game:\nhttp://www.freem.ne.jp/dl/win/5676\nor\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/6njdefyvortznih/Mikun_POP_s.zip\nor\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5TEqsOQHBmQNDUxRk5oamJoWlk/view?usp=sharing\n (the game itself is free, so there's no need to worry!)\n\nThe game has 7 stages and 9 characters, with 3 characters available from the start (Miku, Rin and Luka). The other 6 characters are actually bosses of the first 6 stages, each of them can be bought with \"keys\" after you defeat her. You can't play as the 7th boss (though actually, I'm not entirely sure about this, as there can be a hidden True Ending I haven't found out yet...). Each character has a distinct playstyle (which means normal attack, special attack, speed, and even jump mechanics!).\n\nAs for Miku, her playstyle is the \"basic/balanced\" style. She's well-rounded and comfortable, and is the easiest character to play with (though, of course, being the \"basic\" character, that doesn't mean she's the best). \n\nPlaystyle: Basic/Balanced\nSpeed: Medium\nJump Mechanics: Normal jump mechanics\nNormal attack: Mid-ranged bullet.\nSpecial attack: Huge bullet with infinite range and infinite penetration\nHer pros:\n- Good attack range\n- Great special attack for clearing levels\n- Fairly high jump height\n- Easiest character to get used to\nHer cons:\n- Attacks are generally weak\n- The special attack, though outstanding against small enemies, has very weak firepower compared to other special attacks, so it's not suitable for big enemies and bosses\n- Pretty bad for fighting bosses\n\nThe first zone is Melody Woods, with Akita Neru as the boss, enjoy!\n\nOh, and I know the video is kinda laggy, but that would be the encoder's fault, I compressed the original video in order to make a MUCH smaller file (8.53 GB to 151 MB), thus reducing the uploading time. The game itself is smooth. It's not the game's fault.
