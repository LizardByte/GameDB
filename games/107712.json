This unique multiplayer sci-fi experience challenges players to survive on a harsh, alien planet with a variety of official and community servers hosting persistent worlds for up to 300 players each. CryoFall features top down perspective with hand-drawn 2D graphics.\n\nCryoFall delivers a complex survival experience with unlimited opportunities for players to make their own mark on their world. Discover new ways of farming, hunting, cooking, crafting, mining, building, and trading, with multiple specializations available per character. The challenges of staying alive push players to choose between working collaboratively with each other to build a functional new society in an effort to learn the secrets of this hostile alien world, or succumb to the most basic of urges and try to take what others have worked so hard to build.\n\nBut exploration is also critical. Ensuring the survival of your newfound society rests not only on you and your fellow players but on the strange new world around you: a dangerous landscape full of hidden labs to unearth and exotic alien lifeforms to harvest and fight.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cryofall", "videos": [{"id": 25493, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ATAY0CLZ7tk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATAY0CLZ7tk", "title": "CryoFall - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATAY0CLZ7tk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 26117, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "VoSan80L_Zo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoSan80L_Zo", "title": "CryoFall - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VoSan80L_Zo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
