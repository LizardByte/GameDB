Combos are done with fast key presses or sequential moves, and by taking damage, the fighter gathers magic points that can be used to perform a destructive special attack. Like Virtua Fighter, if a fighter falls from the battle arena, he or she loses from ring out. The usual options such as combat length, number of bouts, difficulty level and auto-block are included."}
