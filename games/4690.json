The object is still to move blocks of four different colored squares across the board; while trying to create a single square of the same color. This all must be done before a \"timeline\" crosses the screen deleting the squares that you make. Deleting four or more squares will add a bonus multiplier to your score. (Refer to the Gameplay section of Lumines for more details).\nThere is no Infrastructure gameplay in Lumines II. The game is visually similar to Lumines Live! and the PC port of Lumines during both gameplay and in the menus.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lumines-ii", "collections": [{"id": 3527, "name": "Lumines"}]}
