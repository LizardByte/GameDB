It is just too damn complicated! In a nutshell, it involves robots (big and small), aliens, space, a crazy person, an alien artifact or something...AND LOTS OF TALKING (with lots of scientific crap)!

Some fights are slow/long because I took my time trying to get the Point Event Slot. I mostly use some combination of Shion, KOS-MOS, MOMO, and chaos. Jr. gets some use but he isnt used much. Ziggy doesnt get NO time because he is super slow. =/ Ironically, I use KOS-MOS a lot and she is kinda slow (Ziggy has 6 Agility. KOS-MOS has 7 Agility). Shame, because he was one of my favorite characters when I played the game the first time. I wish I knew MOMO wrecks the game with MOMO Kiss + Ether Limit. It probably wouldve saved me from the drawnout Rianon Se fight. =_=\n\nSome parts are short. Some parts are long. I blame the cutscenes and plot...AND THE BATTLES!
