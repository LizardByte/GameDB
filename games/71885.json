Players move around the board, buying shops and collecting money from others who land on their shop spaces. Depending on circumstances, some players can forcibly take over another player's shop spaces, or make them inactive for a turn. Players can also hold shares of a block of spaces so that they get paid when someone lands on any space in that block, even if it is not their own.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 35127, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EBd6B8_GobE"}]}
