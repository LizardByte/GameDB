It's a mod for UT2004, but it has nothing to do with a shooter (a pure sports game).\n\nSo you got these football pitches, and you have to get the ball into the enemy goal. You have a hammer tool. With that one you can kick other players around, kill the enemy ballowner with 2 hits and also kick the ball away (volley).\nIn your own penalty zone you can kill all enemy players with one hit. With the ball launcher you can charge up a shot, the longer you hold it the harder it will be and you can even add spin to the ball, so it will curl in the air.\nJust like in football you should have a keeper in your goal. He has some special abilities like he's 30% faster than others,he can dodge and jump higher.\nDeath Ball should be played with 6-10 players\nThe gameplay is very easy too learn, but it's hard to master. At first it seems to be pretty simple, but the more you play the more you realise how complex it is and how many possibilities your team has. The ways to score are infinite.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deathball--1", "videos": [{"id": 60214, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ifP9vYFV7hE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifP9vYFV7hE", "title": "UT2004 - Deathball", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ifP9vYFV7hE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60215, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zSm97YUZgSI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSm97YUZgSI", "title": "Deathball", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSm97YUZgSI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
