The adventure game is set in an unusual world made of a curious mix between 3D real time graphics and 2D black&white comic style animation.\n\nThe traditional point-and-click genre has been perfectly adapted to the main features of the latest consoles in order to ease the developing of the main plot and minigames. The player is involved in a tricky story full of unexpected twists, intrigue, love and vengeance. In Diabolik\u2019s skin, it won\u2019t take too long to become a skilled thief and a master of disguise to rescue his beloved Eva.\n\nCalled to be the bad guy for once, the player will find himself ensnared in fast-paced combat and stealth sequences. Diabolik is a criminal who likes luxury, expensive cars and robs to enrich himself, following his own morality. Eva, the only woman who can keep up with him, likes being involved in mysterious and complicated stories. Diabolik and Eva make up an unconventional couple; they are lovers and partners in crime.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diabolik-the-original-sin", "videos": [{"id": 62768, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PaAMrqM-3ew", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaAMrqM-3ew", "title": "Diabolik: The Original Sin ...
