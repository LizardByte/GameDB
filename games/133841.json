As the battle nears its close, you\u2019ll travel to a special area inspired by Dive to the Heart with visuals featuring some familiar faces from the KINGDOM HEARTS series.\n\nSora\u2019s fighting style in the Kingdom Hearts games has been faithfully adapted to his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. His standard special cycles between three powerful elemental spells\u2014Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga. His other special attacks like Sonic Blade and Aerial Sweep will help you navigate the skies and keep opponents on their toes.
