Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.\n\nA Cursed Song\nThe famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.\n\nAn Unstoppable Entity\nSong of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience: its antagonist, the supernatural entity known only as The Presence, is controlled by an advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) that adapts to your actions and decisions. Experience unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.\n\n13 Playable Characters\nAs a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.\n\nExplore Sinister Locations\nA mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.\n\nFollow Raiser Games on Social Media!\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/raisergames/\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/RaiserGames\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RaiserGamesPublisher\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/raisergames/\n- Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/raisergames\n- Web: http://www.raisergames.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0UNPgz0gK4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0UNPgz0gK4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0UNPgz0gK4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0UNPgz0gK4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0UNPgz0gK4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SONG OF HORROR | COMPLETE TRAILER", "description": "Get Song of Horror on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1096570/\nSong of Horror Episode 5, The Horror and The Song, launches on May 28th. \n\nSong of Horror is a 3rd person, fixed-camera survival horror adventure.
