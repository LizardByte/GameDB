The ship has two weapon shot types. A standard forward shot, which I believe seems to be more powerful in a head on situation, and a spread shot that creates a cone-shaped pattern. This comes in useful when you have a barrage of enemies on both sides of the screen. There is also a shield which becomes vital (if you remember you have it) in tight situations. This replaces the more traditional 'bomb' usually found in the genre. You pass from stage to stage with increased waves of enemies and harder bullet patterns, and given an overall hit percentage at the end of each stage, amounting to higher scores.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cardinal-sins", "videos": [{"id": 142610, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8FwjSJ-ECOI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FwjSJ-ECOI", "title": "Strider (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8FwjSJ-ECOI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
