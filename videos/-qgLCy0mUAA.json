{"id": "-qgLCy0mUAA", "snippet": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [490] Tyrants: Fight Through Time", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nMega lo Mania is a strategy game developed by Sensible Software. It was released for the Amiga in 1991, and ported for a variety of other platforms. It was released as Tyrants: Fight Through Time in North America and Mega-Lo-Mania: Jiku Daisenryaku in Japan.\n\nIn Mega lo Mania, the player takes the role of one of the four demigods who each guide their chosen people in ways of population, resource gathering, research, production and conquest in order to determine the one true master of the planet. Gameplay-wise, it?s more of an economic strategy rather than combat or god simulator. There are nine epochs in the game, followed by the final battle in the tenth epoch. You have to conquer three islands in each of the nine epochs. You start with 100 people and decide how many people to use on each island. Any leftover people get transitioned in the next epoch and added to the new 100 you get for completing the previous epoch. Later in the game, you have the option to turn your additional bases into shelters, which will use every ten people inside them to create one fighter for the final battle. If you fail to preserve your people for the final battle, the game will not allow you to continue past the ninth epoch and will give you a non-standard game over screen, which looks like the ending screen, but with a different message saying that you lost.\n\nAfter beating the game, I show the secret ?JOOLS? password, which allows you to play a Sinistar-like game. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-qgLCy0mUAA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-qgLCy0mUAA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-qgLCy0mUAA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-qgLCy0mUAA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [490] Tyrants: Fight Through Time", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nMega lo Mania is a strategy game developed by Sensible Software.
