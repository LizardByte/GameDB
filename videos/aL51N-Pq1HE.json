New mechanics and new puzzles coming soon.\n\nHIRAETH is a game about mind-bending puzzles and unique platforming challenges, all with stunning graphics and physics-defying mechanics. The overarching plot is a puzzle as in of itself, and the ever-present music elevates the game's dreamy atmosphere. The looming and intensifying creepy aura begs the question: what secrets hide beyond what AMPER want you to see? Will your own mind even be capable of comprehending it?\n\nTraverse AMPER Laboraties, your prison, and uncover the mysteries of the ones who run it.\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/cawezstudios\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/EtX7Xv7txY\nITCH.IO: https://cawezstudios.itch.io/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/cawezstudios\nREDDIT: https://www.reddit.com/user/cawez_stu...\nSOUNDCLOUD: https://soundcloud.com/vestigetunes", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aL51N-Pq1HE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aL51N-Pq1HE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aL51N-Pq1HE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aL51N-Pq1HE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aL51N-Pq1HE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "HIRAETH | Gameplay Trailer", "description": "WISHLIST HIRAETH on STEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2361040/HIRAETH/\n\nHIRAETH's official gameplay trailer for all four chapters.
