It seems odd that they'd opt to not bring over such an import-ready game,  especially considering how well it's done.  I disabled the subtitles because they are available only in Japanese. \n\nIt's a \"interactive movie\" adventure game,  with the typical inventory and logic oriented puzzles, using prerendered corridors through the environments.  The closest comparison I can draw would be against titles like D, Lunacy, and Juggernaut.  Unlike this those games,  though,  there is no horror theme here. \n\nIt takes place during the Renaissance, and derives much of its plot from Shakespeare's work. The game is absolutely beautiful - I don't believe I've seen another game of this style with as high of production values or as classy of an aesthetic. The music is just as good, suiting the serene backdrop pretty well through. The overall quality is pretty surprising given that the whole game fits on just two CDs.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy, but then,  aren't they always in this type of game? It's quite a memorable experience,  and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. \n\n___\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgnU7KOpe7I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgnU7KOpe7I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgnU7KOpe7I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgnU7KOpe7I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UgnU7KOpe7I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Book of Watermarks (PS1) Playthrough  - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sony's 1999 FMV adventure game for the Sony Playthrough,  The Book of Watermarks.\n\nThe Book of Watermarks was a Japanese-region only release,  despite everything being in English but options, save messages, and CD-change prompt.
