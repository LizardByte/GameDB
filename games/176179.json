In the most basic sense our game strives to be the Sci-Fi sandbox upon which you can build a universe of your own. Take command of a stellar civilization and shape an ever-changing galaxy to your liking. Form alliances, fight wars, study the darkest secrets of the universe, or just set out and explore the stars that hang suspended around you."}
