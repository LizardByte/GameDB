The gameplay in this edition is mostly identical to the previous iteration. It is played from an isometric birds eye view and has the same controls with the same moves being possible to do. This includes performing lobs, flip-flap tricks and one-two passing.\n\nLike before the game has a FIFPRO licence which means that it features real life players but it does not have any real team or competition names. In addition to the common friendlies, cups and leagues the game adds two new game modes. There is the Road to 2008 which involves qualifying for and competing in the Euro 2008 and there is a challenge mode where the player has to complete objectives. For example, the first challenge is the World Cup 2006 final and the player takes control of France after Zinedine Zidane is sent off with the objective of winning the final."}
