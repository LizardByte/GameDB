Each location has six different tracks to master with a total of 36 tracks. The different tracks actually are variations of the same track only slightly different. For example drive with different car type, reverse direction, ramps added or safety rails removed, different weather conditions etc. \n \nYou can choose to drive with 1 of 8 different teams, each with different driving behaviour, providing 40 cars in total. There is multiplayer for 2 to 4 players, using split-screen and a link cable. The game also features typical 1990's rave music. \n \nWhen your car rolls over the game will turn you right side up again, but if your car drives into water or falls into lava the game instantly ends."}
