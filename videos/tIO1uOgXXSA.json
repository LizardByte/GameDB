{"id": "tIO1uOgXXSA", "snippet": {"title": "LAST YEAR: AFTERDARK (2019) Official Gameplay Trailer [HD]", "description": "Available on STEAM December 10th, 2019.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1195460/Last_Year/\n\nLAST YEAR: Afterdark is a FREE expansion to the Last Year universe and is the unveiling of a brand new playable Fiend: The Spider. This latest expansion is the debut of Last Year on Steam and is set in a gritty, savage world that\u2019s been overrun by a menacing creature infestation. The infestation introduces PVE to Last Year\u2019s asymmetric formula, and delivers a deeper, more brutal survival layer for both Fiends and Classmates. \n\nIn this update, East Side High School has been redesigned and re-imagined. Players will enter the world on their own terms thanks to another brand new feature: Maining. Players can now play as any Fiend or Classmate 100% of the time, as the original character selection system has been completely overhauled from the ground up. \n\nChapter 1: AFTERDARK also introduces a brand new progression and customization system. Fiends and Classmates are rewarded for good deeds with unlockable cosmetics, emotes, and arcane abilities. With each new Chapter comes a new batch of unlockable content, but that content is ONLY available to be unlocked during the Chapter. Once a player unlocks a piece of content during a Chapter, they\u2019ll have that item forever, but to own it they\u2019ll have to unlock it before the next Chapter begins. \n\nThere are tons of new features that we\u2019re excited to start sharing, and the development team is working on new Chapters that we can\u2019t wait to surprise you with. Last Year is a sandbox for horror that will bring new and unexpected Fiends and features with each new release.\n\nOfficial Last Year channels:\n\ndiscord.gg/lastyearofficial\nwww.lastyearthegame.com\nwww.facebook.com/LastYearGame\ntwitter.com/LastYearGame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIO1uOgXXSA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIO1uOgXXSA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIO1uOgXXSA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIO1uOgXXSA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIO1uOgXXSA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "LAST YEAR: AFTERDARK (2019) Official Gameplay Trailer [HD]", "description": "Available on STEAM December 10th, 2019.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1195460/Last_Year/\n\nLAST YEAR: Afterdark is a FREE expansion to the Last Year universe and is the unveiling of a brand new playable Fiend: The Spider.
