The beloved Real Time Strategy series returns, this time with bigger battlefields, more units, better graphics, new scenarios and legendary commanders with individual abilities \u2013 all of which makes Sudden Strike 4 more tactical and realistic than ever before!\n\nDeveloped as a fully-fledged series entry and not a remake or reboot, Sudden Strike 4 sends you off on three extensive campaigns set amongst the battlefields of World War II. Commanding the British and American, German or Soviet troops, you will lead over 100 different units into battle, including the German bomber Heinkel He111, the Russian T-34 tank, the British Hawker Typhoon fighter plane and the notorious German Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger. In a first for the Sudden Strike series, you can now choose from one of nine individual commanders, such as George Patton or Bernard Montgomery, who will each allow for different approaches to combat and boast unique abilities.\n\nProve your tactical expertise in over 20 demanding single player scenarios, the challenge-focused skirmish mode, and the competitive multiplayer mode. A new reward system rewards clever and tactical play, awarding the player with skill points and bonus content, such as historical film footage of the era.\n\nSudden Strike 4 offers countless ways to vanquish your opponents. Exploit the weak spots of tanks, set up an ambush, occupy buildings with infantry, outmanoeuvre the enemy with clever positioning or unleash devastating air strikes \u2013 how you approach each mission is up to you!", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sudden-strike-4", "videos": [{"id": 13999, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "n0GmytOKDDk"}, {"id": 15086, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3GzjhbVlHsc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GzjhbVlHsc", "title": "Sudden Strike 4 -  Limited Day One Edition | Reversible Covers (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GzjhbVlHsc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
