You can do anything here. If you really don't want to, you don't even have to cook anything. Throw kitchen knives like darts. Set fire to cardboard boxes, cook a steak on them, and then save the day with a fire extinguisher. Build a tower out of pots and trays. Everything with real-life physics.\n\nTHE KITCHEN EXPERIENCE\nHowever, if you'd rather be a cook, the same physics engine gives you unlimited opportunities. Cut some vegetables, put them in a pot and boil. Use a blender to make a soup. Bake a fish fillet, but remember not to burn it!\u2002\u2002See your ingredients transform with temperature. The kitchen experience awaits!\n\nMAKE YOUR CLIENTS HAPPY\nSubtly modify your dishes according to your clients' whims. Use different spices to make them love your cooking, and they will write you a unique review you will not forget!\n\nCOOK YOUR WAY TO THE TOP\nDeliver fine dishes and unlock new, more refined recipes as your fame grows. Acquire social media reviews, Michelin stars and rise through the ranks of the greatest cooks - but beware!
