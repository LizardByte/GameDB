It's a game where you use cars or other strange objects to crash into each other, the player who's head gets smashed first, loses.  In soccer mode, it's whoever can score a goal in their opponents net is who wins. We also check out Drive Ahead missions too!  Chase and Mike tried to make a video about this and most of the gameplay was unusable so there is a montage at the end as well as some extra funny moments of Duddy, Mike & Chase too!
