Although the southern region, Anser, initially resisted subjugation, today it flourishes because of trade with the mainland, and the lives of its people have been enriched. Rananculus, the northern region of Ovis which is surrounded by mountains and forests, accepted the conversion without putting up a fight. At present, inhabitable land is scarce and now only a few aristocrats and civilians live there. Alphonse, the main character of the story and a member of the Order of the Sacred Flame, visits this region to investigate an unusual occurrence. His life will forever be changed from his encounters with the people there.\"", "summary": "\"Highlights and Key Features:\n- Over 40 hours of gameplay and multiple endings!\n- Discover powerful character classes with the new Emblem System!\n- Cast a wide assortment of magic spells to defeat the enemy!\n- Go head-to-head against a friend by using the Game Boy\u00ae Advance Game Link\u00ae cable!\n- All new Quest Mode enables you to discover hidden items and weapons not available in the main game.\n- Utilize the Exchange Mode to trade items, spell books and characters with a friend.\n- Save up to 3 games!\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tactics-ogre-the-knight-of-lodis", "videos": [{"id": 26567, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "mGyVJhQ0F6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGyVJhQ0F6g", "title": "Tactic Ogre  The Knight of Lodis All Summons", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mGyVJhQ0F6g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
