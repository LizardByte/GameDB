Anyway funny Mario game.\n\nI've never played this game before, but I've seen it on the developer's itch page, since they have a clip for whenever RPG Maker 2003 is on sale, I think. So I recognize them occasionally. So when I had to come up with an April Fool's video, this game was on top of that list with a certain pomeranian game.\n\nSo anyway, I originally only intended to play the first game, but then I realized it's sequel had the first game on it's executable, so I decided to do both. Makes for a funnier narrative, too, I think.\n\nSo what did I think about the funny Mario game?? ...I liked it! And thought it was funny, which is what these games generally intend to do. I also was... gripped by the narrative? Sort of? It's very silly, but damn was I invested in the silly. (This was more because of the sequel, which starts at the sewer segment.) So, uhh... very fun game! I really enjoyed it. I don't have much else to say...\n\nAnyway, whenever, if ever, the third part drops, I'll be there. Probably. The fate of the third game is unknown for me, since if it was said on the bird site, I refuse to use it. If it releases the same day as this video... See you next year, I guess??? No promises, though.\n\n(I had malware on my laptop that required me to clean install Windows, so sorry if the video feels/looks off. I didn't think to back up my OBS settings, so I had to start from zero.  It looked... fine to me, but I dunno. )", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRaDsqMhlCk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRaDsqMhlCk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRaDsqMhlCk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRaDsqMhlCk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRaDsqMhlCk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Mario Death Row | RPG Maker Game | No Commentary", "description": "I can't believe Super Mario is fucking dead...
