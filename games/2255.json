Up to four players can participate in this game as play soccer, attempting to kick the ball into another opponent's goal. The soccer in this game, however, has several differences than the real soccer, such as the ability to tackle other players with a minimal penalty, using Mario-themed items to give players an advantage over their opponents, and playing with stage hazards effectively. This game places a higher emphasis on individual character attributes compared to its precedent, by not only assigning stats, but by also giving team captains a unique Super Ability and the Mega Strike, an opportunity to score up to six goals. Another introduced mechanic is the power level of the ball: indicated by the color of the glow, the shots of the ball become more quick and powerful the more active it is, thus making it easier to score goals with.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-strikers-charged", "videos": [{"id": 35957, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "XBinxNwAN5s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBinxNwAN5s", "title": "Mario Strikers Charged Football - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBinxNwAN5s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35958, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "J_MWHeuO-6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MWHeuO-6g", "title": "Mario Strikers Charged Football - Trailer (Wii)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_MWHeuO-6g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35959, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ezqDwJ4evOM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezqDwJ4evOM", "title": "Mario Strikers Charged - Yoshi vs Luigi - Wii Gameplay (4K60fps)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezqDwJ4evOM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
