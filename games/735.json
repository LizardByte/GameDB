There is no technical upgrade tree, and no mining for gold, crystals, or any other random mineral to be used as a monetary source. New units are acquired by spending acquisition points which collect throughout the battle. If the player has a large force, the points will come in very slowly. While the army is small, the points will come in at faster rate. More points can be earned by destroying enemy units, or by capturing special locations called victory locations. Additional units are called in via dropship, which will land in designated landing zones. The player must hold at least one of these landing zones in order to receive these reinforcements. Acquisition points can also be spent on dropship upgrades which include more cargo space, speed, fuel capacity, armor, and weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ground-control-ii-operation-exodus", "videos": [{"id": 121986, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cZBbzCMid40", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZBbzCMid40", "title": "Ground Control 2 E3 2004 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cZBbzCMid40/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 121987, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "AAsojZypKzI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAsojZypKzI", "title": "Ground Control II: Operation Exodus - Official Steam Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAsojZypKzI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 143, "name": "Ground Control"}]}
