Until...\n\nOne fateful night, a mystery assassin shows up to literally suck out Seiji\u2019s life force! His would-be killer is none other than Kanoko, a second-year at the academy\u2014and a covert magical girl tasked with protecting humans against monsters from deep space. It all seems to trace back to a tragedy in Kanoko\u2019s past when a powerful Majin massacred her family... so why target a complete nobody like Seiji?\n\nTo complicate matters, the Starry Sky Council is investigating an anomaly in Kanoko\u2019s body, which means she and Seiji must move in together until further notice. But with Kanoko\u2019s usual ice-cold retorts betraying some decidedly feminine soft spots, Seiji is in for an eyeful of spicy shenanigans around the clock!
