It\u2019s a conversion of what most people know as Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and it\u2019s as perfect a conversion as you\u2019re likely to get. This game takes a different pace from the first Wonder Boy game, being more of an adventure with a slower pace and more strategy. You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree - so far so good. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it. Levels are time limited (shown by an egg-timer on the left) so you need to be quick, or energy is taken away from your heart meter.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bikkuri-man-world"}
