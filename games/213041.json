This hack is very non-linear, as the dungeons are not numbered in quest 1. The dungeons can be beaten in numerous random orders. Any region can be explored from the start, and players can get a good advantage early on by venturing to certain areas first. The second quest is the total opposite and is entirely linear. There is no possible way to beat the dungeons out of order. Just know that if Darknuts or Wizzrobes are seen in the beginning, then save that dungeon for after the others. Play wisely, exploration is rewarded.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
