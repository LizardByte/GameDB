Unreal Engine 5 also introduces a collection of groundbreaking features for rendering real-time worlds in incredible high-fidelity detail. Lumen is a fully dynamic global illumination solution that enables you to create believable scenes where indirect lighting adapts on the fly to changes to direct lighting or geometry\u2014for example, changing the sun\u2019s angle with the time of day, turning on a flashlight, or opening an exterior door. With Lumen, you no longer have to author lightmap UVs, wait for lightmaps to bake, or place reflection captures; you can simply create and edit lights inside the Unreal Editor and see the same final lighting your players will see when the game or experience is run on the target platform. Not to be outdone, UE5\u2019s new virtualized micropolygon geometry system, Nanite, gives you the ability to create games and experiences with massive amounts of geometric detail. Directly import film-quality source art comprised of millions of polygons\u2014anything from ZBrush sculpts to photogrammetry scans\u2014and place them millions of times, all while maintaining a real-time frame rate, and without any noticeable loss of fidelity.\n\nget started: https://www.unrealengine.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8Tb-pT0zy4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8Tb-pT0zy4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8Tb-pT0zy4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8Tb-pT0zy4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8Tb-pT0zy4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Explore a Recreation of M\u00fdrdalssandur, Iceland in Unreal Engine 4", "description": "\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udcf7 steam wishlist - http://steam.pm/app/1749860/ \nhttps://discord.com/invite/Kv2NEynADy   https://twitter.com/lushfoil   https://instagram.com/lushfoil   https://www.tiktok.com/@lushfoil \n\n\ud83c\udf10 http://lushfoil.com \n\ud83d\udce9\ud83d\udc4b matt@lushfoil.com\n\nUnreal Engine enables game developers and creators across industries to realize next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility than ever before.
