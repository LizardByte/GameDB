All you have to do is login a free test account. These Test-Accounts have limited access ingame and are designed for pvp tests and special war events.\n\nThe battle system is designed so that fights last for a moderate time. Infinite chain of control effects, aswell as 1hit KOs are banished from Chimera Online.\n\nThe game is 100% free to play. Everything you want to access ingame you can access without the need of any payment.
