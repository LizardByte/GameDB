Announced as a \"mini-expansion pack\", it is smaller than other expansions in both scope and price, comparable to 2009's Siege of Mirkwood. Unlike all previous expansions, it did not raise the game's level cap. Instead, a new type of quests called \"Missions\" was introduced, which scale to the player character's level, allowing players across all levels to participate.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-war-of-three-peaks"}
