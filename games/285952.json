Night of the Slayers offers a unique 'multiplayer' experience that combines survival horror and suspense played from a first-person perspective. 5 survivors and 2 hunters. While the survivors engage in a tactical struggle to escape alive and the hunters try to hunt the survivors in this tension-filled forest town. The core of the game is an asymmetric multiplayer system where both survivors and hunter players compete against each other. While the survivors try to survive by hiding from hunters, hunters undertake the mission of chasing, catching and executing.\n\nOnce a holiday village:\nThis deserted area, which has only become a holiday town for crows and raccoons until now, has not been provided with electricity or radio broadcasts for a long time due to mysterious circumstances. While a few tourists were passing through this land, the curse of the town touched their vehicles and they were stranded in fear. They did not realize it, but the two greatest executioners of the curse were coming for to purify the souls of the survivors and set them out next to others.", "summary": "Night of the Slayers is a 5v2 first-person survival co-op horror game in which hunters can collaborate as effectively as the survivors.
