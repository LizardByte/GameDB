As the game is a spin-off from the Project Diva series, its gameplay differs greatly from the original series. Players can pick their songs using a Cover Flow system from a selection of 13 songs all sung by Hatsune Miku. This is the first game in the series to not feature any other Vocaloids apart from Hatsune Miku. The game has 10 tiles, arranged in a 3\u00d73 grid with the last column having a 4th tile at the bottom. Each of these tiles has a hiragana Lyric on them, when indicated you are required to flick the tile in the indicated direction. Timing is as essential as the original game as the game still retains the points system as well as accuracy scoring system as the original series.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miku-flick", "videos": [{"id": 5229, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CK0hX8jRDog", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK0hX8jRDog", "title": "\u3010\u30df\u30af\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3011PV\u516c\u958b\u300e\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30a4\u30ba\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u300f15\u79d2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CK0hX8jRDog/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
