A North American release was planned, and even reviewed in gaming magazines,[1][2] but never actually came out. The game was re-released the same year for both the Mega Drive and the Sega CD as Bloodshot, again only in Europe, though the Sega CD version had a homebrew release in North America in 2004. Battle Frenzy was one of the few first person shooters released on the Mega Drive/Genesis.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-frenzy"}
