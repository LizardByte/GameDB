Rolling onto a circle allows you to rotate your cube, opening up branching pathways to help you achieve your goal. Teleporting, wildcard, and falling blocks all spice up the mix. 363 challenges of blocky goodness to complete.\n\nOut now in Steam\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1081500/Side_Decide\n\nJoin the Discord channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/dfnMe9WPme", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4o9XE1r0-c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4o9XE1r0-c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4o9XE1r0-c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4o9XE1r0-c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4o9XE1r0-c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Side Decide Release Trailer", "description": "Side Decide is a relaxing puzzle game that harkens back to the wooden blocks of childhood. \nThe objective is to roll a wooden cube to the end of the level.
