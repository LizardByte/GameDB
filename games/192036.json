The problem is that every platform can disappear randomly, not to mention other players will try to push you off the ledge as well. That's where Jumping Quest is the most impressive, because it requires you to time your approach and test your skills as much as you can. It's an incredible opportunity and the gameplay itself is nothing short of amazing. Do you have what it takes to beat your enemies and push your skills to the next level?", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
