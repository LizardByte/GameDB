Special events and plays are able to be used by the player, such as Ultra Hits and Ultra pitches. With this as the context, there is an exhibition mode and a regular season mode allowing the player to play a season with a chosen team.", "summary": "Baseball Simulator 1.000 was made by Culture Brain exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1989, it was praised by Electronic Gaming Monthly as the \"Best Sports-Themed Video Game\" of 1989. This was largely due to some unique gameplay features that helped it to set itself apart from the many other baseball games released.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baseball-simulator-1-dot-000", "videos": [{"id": 3972, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "HPeYb5gQLlI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeYb5gQLlI", "title": "Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPeYb5gQLlI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
