Only a few, a mere handful of people succeeded to reach the surface, where they were being awaited by the armed forces with direct order to annihilate any witnesses of the catastrophe.\n\nYou are Alex Jones, a young scientist that luckily were wearing an HEV suit, while working, at the time of the accident. You could not even imagine that the way out would be so long and difficult, when leaving the laboratory and entering an elevator.\n\nFamily and friends have already considered you a missing person. But could it be true that a person lost in a huge underground complex would meet them again and tell them the truth about what happened in the Black Mesa Research Facility?", "summary": "A singleplayer mod for Half-Life based on a new version of Half-Life FX Graphics Add-on. It consists of three gameplay levels.\n\nYou will visit a laboratory complex and a part of Black Mesa monorail transit system. Similar to the HLFX: Single demo version, you will face doors with keypads and have an opportunity to manually delve into electric wiring, restoring the power for some systems.\n\nDo not forget that Black Mesa complex is way too large, so there are some secret places in the game that are not accessed easily. Upon revealing a secret the game will show how many places like that are on the level, and they are on each level.
