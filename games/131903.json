However, the game was eventually converted into It's Mr. Pants, released in late 2004.\n\nSome of the planned modes included various challenges around Donkey Kong Island, challenges from Cranky Kong, and a multiplayer mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong-coconut-crackers"}
