You do this by manipulating them to crash into one another using your player icon (the robots always move towards your player, so if you can get two robots moving on the same lateral plane towards you then they are an easy kill.) When two robots crash into one another they form a pile of debris which can also be used to destroy robots.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/autobots"}
