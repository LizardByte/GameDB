The game used the 64DD's internal clock so the creature and the world it was in would continue to grow and change, even when the game wasn't being played.\n\nIt was also intended that the creature could be transferred to a Game Boy cartridge so players could continue to care for the creature on the move. Expansion kits for the game were also planned, although it was unclear how these would have been distributed.\n\nThe game was discussed a number of times during 64DD development, and a playable version of the game was planned to be shown at Nintendo Spaceworld 2000, but it never appeared. In an interview, Shigeru Miyamoto stated that the game had been dropped due to the team being busy with other projects.\n\nIt is believed that several of the game's ideas were later used in Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
