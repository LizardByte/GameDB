Be cautious of potholes, oil slicks, peak time traffic and speed bumps as you seek to deliver your passenger to their destination in a timely manner.\n\nThere are a variety of obscure missions that you\u2019ll need to complete that will include impatient passengers encouraging you to break traffic laws to get to their destination quickly and precariously balancing luggage on the roof rack of your taxi.", "summary": "Combining elements of arcade simulation and strategic management, Taxi! puts you in control of an up and coming cab firm based in any one of three 3D cities.
