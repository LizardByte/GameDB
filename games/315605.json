For the first time, female firefighters also join the volunteer fire department. If you are not alerted to a mission or invited to a training course, you can spend the time in your player apartment or in the freely explorable world.\n\nWith your own car, you can always get to the fire station quickly from anywhere. There you can meet your comrades for courses or missions.\nGo through courses from squad leader 1 to group leader and go on missions according to your qualification. In addition to a theoretical part, the courses always include many practical exercises. In this way, you can gradually expand your knowledge and apply it directly in practice.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/emergency-call-112-the-fire-fighting-simulation-2-volunteer-firefighters"}
