Or maybe not after all?\n\nTime and again, noble warriors set out on the trail of the crystals to return them to their original place. Many have failed so far and the whereabouts are still unclear. The legends speak of three dungeons in which the hearts of Irm are said to be hidden. Will it be possible to retrieve the crystals this time?", "summary": "Crystals Of Irm is an old school RPG with a distinctive combat system and dungeon crawl elements.
