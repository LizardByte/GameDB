What we have here is a conversion for the C64 and it doesn't live up to the NES original, but it's not totally broken either.\n\nThe objective is to rescue April O'Neil and Splinter before taking on Shredder himself. It's just as well that we're told who they are because their sprites look NOTHING like the actual cartoon characters. The April sprite is like a rag doll in a yellow jumpsuit and is simply laughable, Splinter looks like he's got a burlap sack on his head while Shredder is the worst of the lot by managing to look more like Boba Fett than Shredder.\n\nYou can swap between each of the turtles at any time, but you'll want to use Leonardo the most due to the fact that his weapon has a much longer reach than anyone else's.\n\nThe game alternates between horizontal platforming action and overhead perspectives. You also get to drive the Party Wagon in a few sections, but all I can say is Donatello must have some pretty good connections with the local arms dealers because it fires alarmingly large missiles.\n\nThe level graphics are reasonable, but the single tune that plays through the platforming stages (which is to say, 90% of the game) is teeth-grindingly terrible.\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiIKUFjw6KA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiIKUFjw6KA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiIKUFjw6KA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiIKUFjw6KA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiIKUFjw6KA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Unlimited Software and published by Image Works in 1990.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nThis game came out during the Turtles craze of the early 90's and was one of the best selling NES games of all time (roughly 4 million copies).
