While the world policy is marked by the Cold War, Vietnam and the Sixt Day War, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time the shooting of Benno Ohnesorg is the beginning of the West German student movement. In the big world, there is a lot of turmoil, but most of the people are unaware of things happening in small, dreamy, german provincial cities: Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is surprised: he wins a trip to a small, german village: Tr\u00fcberbrook. Truber-what? No Idea! And that he took part in a profit-play, he can\u00b4t really remember \u2026 But since he is quite well suited to get some distance from his dissertation in quantum physics, he makes his way to Tr\u00fcberbrook, Germany, full filled of curiosity.\nTannhauser receives his lodging in the Pension Waldeslust, a charming hostel on the village square. But shortly after his arrival mysterious things happen: some documents disappear from his room, someone seems to have broken in. Somebody is also trying to get in touch with him \u2013 But who?\nGradually, he gets to know the villagers and spa guests, but one is stranger than the other. Only the young scientist Gretchen, who also spent a research trip to Tr\u00fcberbrook, seems normal to him. But before he knows it, Gretchen takes him on a great adventure. And before he can make a clear thought, it becomes obvious that it is perhaps not accidental that he is in Tr\u00fcberbrook \u2013 he is there to save the world!", "summary": "Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe!
