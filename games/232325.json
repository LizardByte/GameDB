The main rule: The puck should rebound from a player, a wall, or a stick. Choose the stage you like and win a hockey match. Or you can arrange a tournament for the World Cup or Olympic medals! Or do you want to participate in legendary hockey matches? Complete stages with 3 stars, collect super-hidden and super-bonus ..ears (Shh!!!).\nBut don't take a slapshot at the players. Or at the glass... ever!\n\nSTAGES\n100 different stages are waiting for you. These hockey rinks are really something you have never seen before! Forgotten clubs, cones, crates and tires (what are they doing here?) - everything is useful when it comes to rebound. Collect stars of skill and lead your hockey team to victory.\nCompleted all stages? Don't worry! There are also NG+ and NG++. The higher your skill, the fewer attempts there will be to notch a goal.\nAnd if it's difficult, watch the demo on how to score a goal.\n\nLEGENDARY GAMES\nHave you ever dreamed of playing in the matches that have become legends? USA vs. USSR, the 1980 Olympic Games final. Have you heard of this match? Can you repeat the success? Or, maybe, you can change history by winning the ill-fated match of the 2002 Olympic Games final?\n\nTOURNAMENT PLAYOFF\nPlay against the strongest hockey teams in the world: Finland and Russia, Canada and the USA, Sweden and Germany, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Can you win and get the Super Cup?"}
