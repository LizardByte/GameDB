But inside the mall, things turn in a slightly different direction... \n \nOn an internal level, K42 is designed as one part a playable game, one part a personal test to see if my artistic abilities have advanced enough to develop something (they have!), one part a metaphorical foray into personal matters, one part me wanting to make a shooty whiz-bang ka-pow run-and-gun fun-in-the-sun video game,and one part a mixing bowl to toss in a lot of half-baked ideas I've had over the years. \n \nIt's an experimental little game. But I had fun developing it. I hope you have fun playing it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
