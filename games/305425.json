The Germanic tribes win back more important provinces, but they need a strong leader to gather around.\n\nIt will be your task to lead the campaign from there and progress through Europe, province by province! But you are not alone. Other factions are also ready to fight for the same goal: capture Rome and be part of history!", "summary": "Forge your Kingdom amidst the Ruins of Rome!
