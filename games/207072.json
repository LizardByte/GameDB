But finally the virus is transmitted to the space station.\n\nSoon there is a split within the Federation in space between the \"Colonists\" and the \"Reconstructionist\". The \"Colonists\" advocate starting interstellar colonization, abandoning Earth, and harvesting all available resources, including minerals and seawater, before leaving the planet, draining the entire planet. The \"Reconstructionists\" advocate rebuilding the Earth, modifying the evolution of human DNA to readapt to the Earth's harsh environment, and working with the Earth's remnants to restore the Earth's ecology.\n\nDue to the long-standing conflicts between the two sides, the \"Colonists\" suddenly launch an armed rebellion in the space station, and the war is taken to space.
