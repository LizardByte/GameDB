Initially a commercial release, it was made available for free around the time of the PC version's release, where it was included by default. It is a separate story campaign with Blade Wolf as the protagonist, a boss for Raiden in the original game. It is a robot wolf with a chainsaw on its back who originally worked for Mistral. The campaign is set prior to the encounter with Raiden at Abkhazia in the original game and the story is told as a flashback. Just like the first DLC most of the environments are reused from the original game, most notably R-01.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-blade-wolf", "collections": [{"id": 44, "name": "Metal Gear"}, {"id": 2801, "name": "Metal Gear Rising"}, {"id": 2128, "name": "Metal Gear Solid"}]}
