Suddenly, the groundbreaking device I created becomes a deadly weapon, and the only way to survive is to use it.\n\nIn a desperate bid to escape the clutches of my ruthless boss, I make a split-second decision to transport myself and three colleagues to another universe \u2013 Orbem.\n\nOrbem greets us with a host of fantastical challenges. From tyrannical Elves to racist lizard humanoids, and even rabid Pixies, survival in this magical realm demands every ounce of our knowledge and skill.\n\nAnd with a dark sorcerer threatening our very existence, I still have to find a way back home and thwart my CEO's sinister plans before and save Earth.\n\nExplore the universe inspired by the novel series \"The Homonian Chronicles\" as you visit landmarks and meet various characters from the books.", "summary": "A pixel art RPG game where you can walk around the fictional universe \"Orbem\" based on The Homonian Chronicle Hard Sci-Fi / Fantasy novel series written by Scott V.
