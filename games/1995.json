According to the message, an evil dragon named Fang has enslaved the peaceful and quiet Turtle Island. Using black magic, the beast has turned the natives into willing servants who obey his every command. The only inhabitants unaffected by the dragon's spells are the twenty shamans who used to rule the island with the blessing of the people - but their power is fading fast, and if the shamans fail, all hope is lost.\n\nOur hero must set out on the journey of his lifetime and save the creatures and people of Turtle Island from the evil dragon!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/akimbo-kung-fu-hero"}
