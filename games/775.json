Control them. Enemies? Crush 'em! And there will be enemies. You're not the only Mission Commander trying to colonize the planets. You'll have to push yourself to the limit to survive the ultimate showdown in strategic warfare. It's espionage, heavy artillery, offensives, counter offensives and intelligence - all with maximum consequences!
