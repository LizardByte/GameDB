Tense, strategic battles focusing around card-decks provide a heretofore unseen level of intrigue in this Fantasy RPG. With a robust single-player mode, architecture system, the game also stays true to its roots by retaining the browser game-style gameplay that catapulted this genre to prominence.\n\n- Summon Units: Players\u2019 tactical prowess will be tested in terms of where and when to summon units.\n- Turn-Based Battles: Summoned units will, independent of the player, follow a set of rules as the battle progresses.\n- Card Deck: Players collect cards, strengthen them, and trade, creating their very own personalized decks.\n- Single-Player Mode: The game\u2019s robust single-player mode is perfect for those who would rather focus solely on battle enemies with none of the back-and-forth to distract them.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/divine-grimoire"}
