He wants to restore the power of the Old Faith in Britannia and he always reaches his goals.\n\nBow down before the gods of the ancients. Fear the creatures coming back from the twilight and respect the ways of the druids. And follow the warrior-king, who will conquer Britannia.\n\nThis expansion is the twin of King Arthur - The Saxons, offering a wide array of new content (i.e. beasts and other monsters) as well as a brand new campaign. The economic system of the base game has been redesigned for a totally new campaign structure. The player will now be able to play in a sandbox mode as the champion of the Old Faith. There is also a complex diplomatic system where campaign winning conditions can be set by the player in an open, non-linear gameplay environment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-arthur-the-druids", "videos": [{"id": 22874, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_ZD8AB5vTpo"}, {"id": 22875, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1liZhpOgJgw"}]}
