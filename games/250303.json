The action starts in the 80s of the last century. The player takes on the role of a rapper who sets up his first music studio in a rented apartment. Our task is to break out of the underground and become a part of the mainstream for good, opening our own label or creating the best clothing brand. Beefs, chases, money, green leaves, shootings, gang wars or maybe a softer way to success? The way the player chooses to reach the top will depend only on him/her. At the beginning of the game, the player's budget is limited, so you have to decide which aspect of the production you want to devote more attention to at the cost of the other elements.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rap-simulator"}
