It adds in the following 3 extra modes for you to play: Sandbox - here is your chance to create your own caves and populate them with whatever bad guys you feel like! Rush Mode - digger dwarfs will continuously spawn, without pause. Dark Mode - if the standard Arcade mode is not enough of a challenge for you (or you just want life for your Dwarfs to be a little bit more scary) then play this mode. In this mode, the unexplored sections of the map are ALL dark - nothing is marked for you. Send your dwarfs forth to explore and collect gold and loot. Or die. Or both, of course!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dwarfs-f2p-skirmish-pack"}
