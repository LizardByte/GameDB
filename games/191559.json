They meet Holly and Cindy, and change into assassins' robes to blend into the crowd and to take part in the festivities. While Gladiolus and Ignis head off, not being much interested in the assassins, Noctis and Prompto explore the festivities together, as Assassin's Creed is their favorite game series. Within Lestallum, The Assassin is a figure of legend in its history, regarded as a vigilante hero from a far off nation who fought against oppression that once ruled over the city in an age long ago.\nAs they return to the hotel to meet with the others, they learn the Niflheim Empire has made its rounds into Lestallum. Noctis and Prompto shadow Loqi Tummelt, an imperial general they beat back in Duscae, while Ignis and Gladiolus check up on their car. Loqi takes Holly captive when she doesn't let them access to the EXINERIS Industries power plant. As they return to the hotel, Noctis feels his magic powers fading. They find the Leville guarded by Loqi's magitek infantry, but Noctis can warp to the second floor to go unnoticed. The party hatches a plan to save Holly that involves Noctis covertly assassinating MTs around town, as he cannot use the power of kings as long as Niflheim's Wallbreaker Wave is in effect. To get access to the power plant where the Wallbreaker Wave generator is, Noctis and his friends collect keycards from MTs until Loqi himself arrives.\nNoctis shadows Loqi to the power plant, but after reclaiming the last keycard from him, Loqi escapes and Noctis makes his escape as well, as the magitek infantry begins to attack Lestallum to catch him. Noctis rendezvouses with his friends, and while one of them accompanies Cindy to the power plant to dismantle the Wallbreaker Wave generator, the others defeat Loqi in his magitek armor. Noctis reclaims the power of kings and drives Loqi and his infantry away from Lestallum so the festival can continue.", "summary": "Final Fantasy XV: Assassin's Festival was a free downloadable content event for Final Fantasy XV in collaboration with Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series.
