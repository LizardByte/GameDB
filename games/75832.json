An experience that will challenge your wits as you push to survive, uncover a multitude of secrets, and earn the high score. \nThe Bounty is sometimes funny, and sometimes brutal; full of introspective and smashing the fourth wall. It's in essence, an arcade-like RPG. A fast, streamlined experience with no experience levels to grind, no random encounters. You'll journey through the four episodes, each with many elements that can vary randomly, with the simple goal of clearing the game and scoring as high as you can. \n \nGameplay consists of exploration, quick yet brutal battles, traps, treasures, secrets, puzzles, riddles; and more. The Bounty packs a lot of variety into it's levels, while staying cohesive. In addition to the Competitive story mode, there's Practice- which removes the scoring element, but helps you to master the game with a variety of perks including autosave, an item to freely save progress, and a special powerful item. \n \nENDLESS DUNGEON MODE \nWant a change of pace? Head into Endless Mode; begin with a full load of equipment and items, and head into the ever-changing dungeon. Get as many floors in, and as high of a score as you can! \n \nWith free add-on Episodes and Endless Dungeon packs post-launch, new challenges will continue to await you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-bounty-v2"}
