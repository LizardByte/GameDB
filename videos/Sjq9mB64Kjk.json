Why would you play this instead of the original outrun...\n\nThe music is not very memorable and the racing engine seems to be of lower quality then the original outrun game let alone the gfx.  Its not all bad though.  The turbo feature can be handy to gain back some time, but because it pretty much auto matic after hitting top speed, can land you in trouble too.  Also some routes feature upper and lower tracks which is interesting.\n\nI had a look for the cheats to the game and the so called Hyper Expert mode is bogus and doesnt work. (no mention of a hyper/exper/very hard mode when examining with a hex editor either).  Also I suspect level select cheat to be bogus to as it allows you to select starting stage anyway.  Music select trick works however. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sjq9mB64Kjk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sjq9mB64Kjk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sjq9mB64Kjk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sjq9mB64Kjk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [150] Outrun 2019", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nNot sure why sega thaught it was a good idea to licence out the Outrun name to a third party.
