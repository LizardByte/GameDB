The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into their sides at high speed. The game has more to offer: a head to head mode with only two cars or the legendary destruction derby itself - a huge arena, every car starts at the edge of it, and then - have a nice crash!"}
