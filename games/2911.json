After competing \u2014 and losing \u2014 on the television dating show Stallions, Larry gets an all-expenses-paid trip to La Costa Lotta, a refined health spa. Due to his status as non-paying guest, he is treated rudely by the staff and given the worst room on the premises. As such, none of the available women in the resort want anything to do with Larry, though it is possible to change their minds with the right gifts.", "summary": "Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. All the events from the previous games are forgotten. Larry is once again single, and again his goal is to capture the interest of various ladies. By sheer coincidence, Larry finds himself on a TV Game Show called \"Stallions\". He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry! Uh... or is it really so? It is the player's goal to find out!\n\nThis instalment focuses more on conversations with women and puzzles than on the storyline. The entire game is spent at La Costa Lotta. There are plenty of traditional inventory-based puzzles to solve in the game. Larry can die, but the player is allowed to try again every time that happens, without the need to restore a saved game. This is also the first Larry game with SVGA graphics, and voice-overs in the CD version.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 17250, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VINuOmJH1_I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VINuOmJH1_I", "title": "Leisure Suit Larry 6 (PC/DOS) Longplay, 1994, Sierra On-Line \"CD Version\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VINuOmJH1_I/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 504, "name": "Gary"}, {"id": 10723, "name": "Cav Vuarnet"}, {"id": 10729, "name": "Char Donay"}, {"id": 10725, "name": "Mer Lowe"}, {"id": 10727, "name": "Art"}, {"id": 10732, "name": "Daryl"}, {"id": 1592, "name": "Jimmy"}, {"id": 6112, "name": "Mark"}, {"id": 10724, "name": "Gammie Boysulay"}, {"id": 10721, "name": "Leisure Suit Larry"}, {"id": 10728, "name": "Sham Payne"}, {"id": 10730, "name": "Thunderbird"}, {"id": 10722, "name": "Burgundy"}, {"id": 10726, "name": "Shablee"}, {"id": 10731, "name": "Billy Dee"}, {"id": 3472, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3560, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vsljodd573c7kdcwr8wu.jpg"}, "name": "Kenny", "species": 1}, {"id": 123, "name": "Rose"}, {"id": 56, "name": "Narrator"}]}
