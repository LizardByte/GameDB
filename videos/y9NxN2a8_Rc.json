As far as I can tell, aside from the title the changes are to the roster, which I've heard is intended to reflect the players that were current when this was made, and the announcer, who has been redubbed into a language I believe is intended to be Brazilian Portuguese... however, since the creators are Peruvian, the pronunciation sounds very heavily Spanish, and some words are just Spanish instead of Portuguese, like Jap\u00f3n instead of Jap\u00e3o. It ends up sounding more like a weird Spanish-Portuguese creole instead of actual Portuguese. It sounds really freaking hilarious if you speak either language.\n\nRonaldinho Soccer actually seems to be an entire series of made-for-Brazil redubbed soccer game romhacks... yeah, they love futebol.
