Heavy amounts of pollution spread around from collapsed nuclear power plants and -warheads. Not many survived from those deadly times.\n\nChildren born mutated or dead taking their mothers with them. Fathers walking alone in bitterness and sorrow driven to cannibalism as food resources slowly ran out. In this sad new world nature and man are trying to survive and find balance.\n\nStill some individuals manage to trust one another just enough to establish groups providing protection, food, clean water, medicine, electricity and knowledge for better life.\n\nAino is one of those lucky ones to be part of a group.
