{"id": "GeIAjCeVUEA", "snippet": {"title": "New York City Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Greg Nelson and published by Synapse Software in 1984.\n\nForeword: This game was played from beginning to end without tool assists. The game randomly generates the map and road traffic each time you play so input recording becomes useless. The only option is to play it for real!\n\nBasically, you play some guy who's sightseeing in New York and the objective is to visit each of the various landmarks and complete a mini-game in each of them. The buildings you have to visit are shown in the bottom-left of the screen, each of which represented by a 2-letter code. You can only enter the buildings currently active and any others you do try to enter will appear as closed (with the exception of the bank and subway).\n\nThere are no lives in the game, but you must not run out of cash. If you get hit by traffic or fail in the mini-games, you lose money. You can get more money by visiting the bank and completing a mini-game there, but it becomes progressively harder each time you try.\n\nI'll try and explain the objective of each mini-game as they're rather obscure:\n\n1) Zoo: you have to draw cages round each of the animals (1 animal per cage). You press the yellow bar at the top to trap each animal you've drawn a cage around.\n\n2) Post Office: Collect the letter; avoid the mail hoppers; get it franked and then post it into the correct mailbox.\n\n3) Mart: Take pretzels and place them into the 4 corners of the shop without touching the other people or any of the walls.\n\n4) Subway: Collect a token and ride a subway train.\n\n5) Automat: You must visit the automat at 12:00 pm. Purchase burgers from the teller at the top of the screen and catch them before the other hungry customer eats them.\n\n6) World Trade Centre: Collect a pretzel from the top of the building and escape. You have to lure one of the other men to build a bridge across the top so that you can grab it.\n\n7) Empire State Building: Pretzel capture.\n\n8) UN Building: Pretzel capture.\n\n9) Grant's Tomb: Pretzel capture.\n\n10) Citicorp Centre: Pretzel capture.\n\n11) City Hall: The final building you must visit. Identical to pretzel capture but with the key to the city instead of a pretzel; complete this and you've won the game.\n\nYou have access to a car with a limited amount of gas that can get you round the city quicker than walking. Your car can smash up any of the other cars, but watch out for the tow-truck, which can annihilate anything it touches.\n\nIf you crash your car or get hit by a car whilst on foot, you'll be transported to the hospital and charged $200. If you don't have enough cash then the game will end.\n\nThis was a really weird game, but quite ambitious and I remember it fondly. The hardest games to complete are the mart and the post office. If you can clear these, the rest of the game is relatively simple.\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeIAjCeVUEA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeIAjCeVUEA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeIAjCeVUEA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeIAjCeVUEA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeIAjCeVUEA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "New York City Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Greg Nelson and published by Synapse Software in 1984.\n\nForeword: This game was played from beginning to end without tool assists.
