Sim families can enjoy dozens of new activities on an inviting vacation island, free from the drudgery of the daily grind. Drop a fishing line, try a little snowboarding, or just relax by the beach. Don't forget to do some souvenir shopping before it's time to go back home.\n\nThis add-on allows routine-weary Sims to escape the confines of their suburban neighborhoods and visit entirely different locations full of new activities, objects, opportunities for social interaction, and an assortment of new non-player characters. The resort staff members strive to serve Sim needs as best they can. Costumed performers in each location entertain the kids.\n\nBut don't let the sneaky PickPocket end the fun early - he'd like nothing better than to pilfer a few Simoleans from distracted tourists. Fancy-free vacationers should also be wary of poison ivy, or even a case of \"Montezuma's Revenge.\" As in the earlier Sims expansions, a diverse variety of new situations will bring out the best (and worst) in favorite Sim characters. The island is even customizable, with areas begging to be developed or rebuilt by creative virtual architects and landscapers.", "summary": "The Sims: Vacation, known as The Sims: On Holiday in the Republic of Ireland, the UK, China and Scandinavia, is the fourth expansion pack for The Sims. Vacation introduces new items, characters, and features, as well as a new destination called Vacation Island where Sims can take vacations with family members or with other Sims. This marks the first time Sims can stay on lots away from home, meaning the game can be saved while a Sim is on Vacation Island. Vacation Island is split into three distinct environments: beach, forest, and snow-capped mountain. Sims can purchase or find souvenirs and either stay at a hotel or rent a tent/igloo.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sims-vacation", "videos": [{"id": 1969, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MBTl9VlobR0"}, {"id": 52896, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "m4LfV2aGuig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4LfV2aGuig", "title": "The Sims Vacation commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4LfV2aGuig/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
