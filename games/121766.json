Equipped with the \u201cPanties of Light\u201d to guide them, our heroes embark on their mythical quest.\n\nThe original Moero Crystal was a 2015 PlayStation Vita game, but it never saw a release outside of Asia! While a follow-up to Monster Monpiece and Moero Chronicle, Moero Crystal H is a standalone story featuring all new characters. This remastered edition features an upgraded HD presentation, all previous DLC characters, English language subtitles, and the new \u201cDouble Scratch\u201d feature, which updates the \u201cLoving Scratch\u201d mode so players can interact with and raise the affection of two monster girls at once! (now featuring HD rumble support).\n\nMoero Crystal H features deep turn-based combat as players explore a series of grid-based dungeons. Fight and recruit more than 80 monster girls, then mix and match their outfit combinations to change their appearance and skills. Climb aboard the \u201cFunyaton-Go\u201d for shoot\u2019em up sections and discover secret stages hidden within the monster girls. Upgrade your gang\u2019s living quarters and pair up monster girls as roommates. With its delightfully quirky fantasies and offbeat humor, Moero Crystal H is the ultimate hedonistic romp!\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 37093, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "0LOLeWP_S9s"}]}
