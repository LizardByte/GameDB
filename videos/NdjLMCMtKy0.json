In Tubeway, the player must destroy incoming enemies while dodging the germ (the \"eye\" that bounces up and down inside the cage at the lower left corner before it goes after the player). The game becomes unplayable at Level 18 (I guess no one is supposed to go that far without cheats), so I stopped at Level 21.
