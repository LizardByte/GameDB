You will collect skill upgrades and extra hearts that add to your overall life as you progress through this lush world.\nWhat\u2019s more is Ayo\u2019s lighthearted, but emotional storyline. Collectible comic book pages in each level tear away the mystery behind Bo\u2019s disappearance and drive Ayo onward.
