All the while butting heads with wacky friends and foes! Levels are very open ended and the moveset compliments this, with you having a lot of freedom to tackle challenges in all sorts of different ways.\n\n\nThe artstlye is HEAVILY inspired by shows such as Invader Zim and Super Milk Chan, along with all kinds of 2000s internet animations. Music is inspired by many 2000s videogames (e.g. Jet Set Radio) and compliments the game's bombastic vibe. This crazy cartoony atmosphere is not just an aesthetic thing though, some levels have a chance to take some WIIIILD turns that'll keep even the LOWEST attention spans entertained. \n\nJoin the Discord for updates:\nhttps://discord.gg/r8mDz3F3", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SeWG7TY-AM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SeWG7TY-AM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SeWG7TY-AM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SeWG7TY-AM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SeWG7TY-AM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "RAVE ROUGH - SAGE 2024 TRAILER", "description": "ARE YOOOUUUU READYYYYY?!??!?\n\nRave Rough is a comedic and chaotic puzzle platformer about chucking your exposable vinyl collection to bounce your way throughout many platforming challenges!
