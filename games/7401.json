When your music gets intense or calmer, so does the gameplay. Enemies appear and shoot on the beat of the music. Some weapons are music-driven. Each song has its personality and it directly translates into gameplay. \n \nReplayability \nIn Symphony, each song in your collection not only becomes a unique level, but also provides you with an item you can equip and challenges you with score targets to reach. As you progress through the game, you unlock new difficulty levels, new items and abilities! This means you have many reasons to play your favorite song over and over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/symphony", "videos": [{"id": 2657, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0K6utV_JWUQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K6utV_JWUQ", "title": "Symphony Game Trailer (2012)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0K6utV_JWUQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3962, "name": "Symphony"}]}
