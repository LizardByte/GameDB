Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warios-woods", "videos": [{"id": 81535, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rpi_9T-tvv8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpi_9T-tvv8", "title": "(SNES) Warios Woods - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rpi_9T-tvv8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
