Take control of a team of Mutants navigating a post-human Earth. Created by a team including former HITMAN leads and the designer of PAYDAY.\n\n\u2022 TACTICAL COMBAT: Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games. \n\n\u2022 EXPLORE A POST-HUMAN EARTH: Journey through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside. Check back at the Ark, a neon-bathed oasis of ill repute and questionable characters, to restock your supplies and plan out your next adventure. \n\n\u2022 CONTROL A TEAM OF MUTANTS: A duck with an attitude problem and a boar with anger issues; these aren\u2019t your typical heroes. Get to know Dux, Bormin, Selma, and many other characters each with their own unique personality and deranged perspective on the world and their situation.\n\n\u2022 MASTER THE STEALTHY APPROACH: Sneak through shadows to avoid conflict or to catch enemies unaware. Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise.\n\n\u2022 UNLOCK MUTATIONS: Unlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selma\u2019s Stoneskin, Bormin\u2019s Charge, and Dux\u2018 uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow.\n\n\u2022 DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS: Use the environment to your advantage. Stay out of floodlights, hide from line of sight, or just blast down fully destructible walls and buildings and wreak utter havoc. \n\n\u2022 LOOT, LOOT EVERYWHERE: From makeshift slingshots to high-powered rifles and top hats to police vests, make sure you equip your Mutants for the dangers ahead. Nothing says post-human quite like a mutated boar in spiked metal armor charging at you with a blunderbuss in his hands. \n\nWebsite: http://www.mutantyearzero.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/MYZRoadToEden\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/MYZRoadToEden\nSteam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/760060/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooHyh0seWvw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooHyh0seWvw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooHyh0seWvw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooHyh0seWvw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooHyh0seWvw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "What is Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden?", "description": "COMING TO PC, PLAYSTATION 4, AND XBOX ONE DEC 4 2018!\nDeveloped by The Bearded Ladies, published by Funcom.\nPC pre-order on http://www.mutantyearzero.com\n\nMutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a tactical adventure game combining the turn-based combat of XCOM with story, exploration, stealth, and strategy.
