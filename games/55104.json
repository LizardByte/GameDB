The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skiing--1", "videos": [{"id": 15575, "name": "VR", "video_id": "TeSjLTInpSQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeSjLTInpSQ", "title": "Classic Game Room - Activision's SKIING for Atari 2600 review", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TeSjLTInpSQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
