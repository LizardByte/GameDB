Lumerea is home to people of all shapes and sizes, who lived together in relative peace until The Shattering. Now the natural flow of magic has been disrupted, and chaos spreads across the lands.\n\nYou and many others like you have chosen to rise up and fight back the tide of monsters and stand agaisnt chaos. Some come for noble ideals, some come for fame whilst others harbour motivations based in self interest. However you came to the battlefield one goal remains above all, to prove you and your allies are the world's greatest team of super Heroes.", "summary": "Evercore Heroes is a unique, competitive PVE game where players compete to prove they are the world\u2019s best team of heroes. Set in a rich, science fantasy world called Lumerea, the game breaks new ground by combining the real-time, skill-based teamplay and action with the adventure of co-operative dungeon runs.\n\nIn Evercore Heroes, four teams of four compete with each other simultaneously in a brand-new session-based PVE experience. To win, players must power up their heroes, charge their Evercore, and triumph in the final head-to-head challenge. The best teams will work together to find the right composition and strategy, balancing tradeoffs between building their own power and making the battle more difficult for the other teams.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/evercore-heroes--1", "videos": [{"id": 89282, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "DnKHUSkjh_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnKHUSkjh_U", "title": "Evercore Heroes - Official Gameplay Trailer | Closed Beta begins June 20th 2023!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DnKHUSkjh_U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 89283, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "MXBNsj9Rd-U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBNsj9Rd-U", "title": "This is Evercore Heroes - Official Gameplay Walkthrough | Closed Beta Begins June 20th", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MXBNsj9Rd-U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 89284, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "QvfadToglvk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvfadToglvk", "title": "Evercore Heroes Announcement Trailer  - All For One | Hidden Citizens & HAEL", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QvfadToglvk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
