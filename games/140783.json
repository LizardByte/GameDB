Now he only has one goal: to prevent those 8 people from going to the party. How? Without stepping out of his room, using social networks. The player will have to investigate, manipulate, stalk and blackmail to obtain his precious pizza.\n\nUse their own information against them\nSee a suspicious text? Save it! A compromising picture? Send it! All information can be used: get to know everybody and become a social hitman. Compare info across networks and contact their friends, help them out or antagonize them. You could find them a better plan or break their relationships: do whatever you can to prevent them from attending the party.", "summary": "The Pizza Situation is a satirical social-networks simulator where you have to investigate profiles, interact, manipulate and use information to achieve your ultimate goal: Pizza.
