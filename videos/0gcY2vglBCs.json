{"id": "0gcY2vglBCs", "snippet": {"title": "LEGO Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension [PC] - High Quality Playthrough! (and Speedrun)", "description": "Speedrun in 1:18:57, which is about five and a half minutes behind my world record\n\nSo I finally got this game to run on my PC, which is strange because normally the grapple physics are broken. Most other things are fine, and the game actually loads faster, but you can't grapple at all (rendering level 2, level 5, level 7, level 8, level 9, and level 10 unplayable). The only way I got it to work was by modifying the configuration file (GAME.INI) and forcing the game to run at 2560x1440 and 144hz (my native monitor resolution). The startup screen doesn't allow for settings this high normally, so I then had to bypass the initial startup window and launch the game directly. This only works at maximum graphics, oddly enough - anything less than full-screen and the grapple physics fail again.\n\nSome notes about the speedrun:\n\n- Timing starts the first frame of the initial cutscene (which only plays at the start of a new game) and ends when Gorm is defeated\n\n- I wasted ~50 seconds by falling down at 5:53... oops\n\n- I wasted 10 seconds by falling at 18:00. I kinda hate this part, and I fell here in the world record run too, but time wasted is time wasted (and actually I was a lot faster here than the world record)\n\n- I wasted 24 seconds by falling to my death at 28:25... oops\n\n- I fell off the platform at 48:00, which wasn't cool and wasted about 30 seconds\n\n- I *didn't* fall at 52:08, which is an improvement over the world record run!\n\n- I leapt to my death at 54:31, and actually did so a second time. You don't see the second death here because I cut it out of the video - you can tell because the timer jumps 20 seconds ahead\n\n- I leapt to my death about 5 or 6 times at 55:35, and the timer jumps ahead about 90 seconds as a result (to save you the agony of watching my death over and over)\n\n- Of course, I got a music glitch at 55:44, where a new music track fades in (for a new area) but the old one just forgets to leave. This glitch lasts all the way until 1:00:41, where I actually died to the stupid machinery (which I promise doesn't normally happen)\n\nAll in all, this speedrun isn't that great. I mean, it still beats all but my top two runs, but I died close to 10 times and generally failed a bunch of things that no respectable gamer should fail. But I mostly wanted to upload this to show that I could play it again, and that the game looks much better in high quality (duh).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcY2vglBCs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcY2vglBCs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcY2vglBCs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcY2vglBCs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcY2vglBCs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "LEGO Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension [PC] - High Quality Playthrough!
