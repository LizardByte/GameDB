Meigs stands out in flight simulation as one of the most well-known and frequently visited destinations for virtual pilots. Before its tragic demise, the airport served as the default starting location, and for many years the only location, for the Microsoft Flight Simulator series up until Flight Simulator X.\n\nMeigs Field has a single asphalt runway measuring 3,899ft by 150ft. Traffic at the time of closure was an average of 132 aircraft per day. The traffic was 90% transient general aviation, five percent air taxi, five percent local general aviation, and less than one percent military traffic. Meigs Field also saw commuter air service between the 1960s and 1980s, typically with small twin engine aircraft.", "summary": "Using every resource available from on-site visits to archived information, Meigs Field from Orbx has been recreated with the utmost degree of historical accuracy - from the terminal\u2019s historic architecture and glass curtain walls to the challenging approaches, every effort has been made to capture the look and feel of Meigs Field as it stood on its final day. Additionally, the surrounding parks district has been updated to its current, modern look and heavily enhanced. Surrounding points of interest include the Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum of Natural History, Soldier Field, Navy Pier and the Art Institute of Chicago. It includes a separate control panel enabling you to customize ground textures and adjust the density of ground assets.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-steam-edition-meigs-field-kcgx"}
