One day Prince Galen rides by and asks for a drink of water. Rapunzel lets down her hair so that he can climb into her tower and the two become friends. The prince visits often and tells Rapunzel stories of his travels. However the witch finds out and puts a spell on the prince saying that he must wander for the rest of his days never being able to find his way back to any place he has visited before. Only a kiss from Rapunzel can break the spell but, because he's already been to the tower he can never return there. There's only one solution, Rapunzel cuts off her hair to make a rope, climbs down from her tower, and goes in search of the prince.", "summary": "The game is an interactive storybook in which the player helps Princess Barbie rescue Prince Galen.
