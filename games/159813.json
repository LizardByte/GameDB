The employees and the memories they shared might have survived, but without a building, there can be no cafe; Hitoshi and co. are left with no choice but to abandon Famille.\n\nBut as luck - or perhaps fate - would have it, Hitoshi gets a second chance when he receives a phone call from a new mall asking him to open a branch of Famille inside their building. Hitoshi can't refuse the offer to carry on his brother's will, and after a few twists and turns, a new Famille is born with Hitoshi as the manager.\n\nOf course, life never quite goes that smoothly. Things are a mess both in the kitchen and on the floor because two key staff members refused to return. Hitoshi himself had to take a break from college in order to make opening the new cafe a reality. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is staring Famille right in the face - Curio, the popular cafe that Famille was \"inspired\" by in the first place, happened to open a branch in the same shopping center directly across from Famille...\n\nAnd thus the new Famille's battle for survival begins.", "summary": "Parfait Remake is a Bishoujo romance visual novel about two cafes competing for business.
