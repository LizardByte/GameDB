You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, thirst, hunger, wildlife and your own state of mind while finding your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help.\n\nWinter Survival is a fully fledged survival game even going into Early Access, with dynamic combat, stealth, base building and its unique sanity system just to name a few. Multiple game modes and difficulties allow you to experience the game differently and tailor it to your taste.\n\nVenture through snow-covered forests, mountains, and frozen lakes. Grapple with treacherous terrain, deadly animals, and harsh winter conditions. Find shelter, cook meals, and rest, ready to face the next day. Hope it won\u2019t be your last\u2026\n\nYou are not the first person to visit this area. There have been many before you. More than a century ago some even lived here. If you explore your surroundings you may find things they left behind that will still be useful to you. Explore various areas and discover their story, like a town built by people who are long gone. Force open doors, avoid traps, and make abandoned structures work again. Find personal belongings as you dive deeper into the town\u2019s past. Will you be able to uncover its secrets?\n\nCold, thirst, hunger and physical as well as mental exhaustion are the five major factors you have to worry about. It doesn\u2019t however end there. Injuries and sickness are other factors and then there is the weather. Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isn\u2019t any better either. Don\u2019t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable.\n\nFurther variety comes in with our event system where random events can save your day unexpectedly or make the nightmare even worse. Things do not have to be that bleak or stay that way all the time. The adaptation system allows you to open up new survival skills and strengthen your abilities. And then there is our unique sanity system to make things really interesting\u2026\n\nThe most deviant enemy in a desolate land, is one\u2019s mind. In Winter Survival you will experience an unforgiving world where it\u2019s hard to distinguish reality from madness, due to the unique sanity system.\n\nIn reality, your mind becomes a problem way sooner than starvation. It starts with fatigue symptoms, losing your will to continue the struggle up to imagining things and even full blown hallucinations. Fear and the stress associated with it form another layer that can influence your perception and together all these factors make for a highly interesting and different survival experience.\n\nHunt or be hunted. Use the environment to your advantage. Observe your prey, study its behaviour, make and set traps to capture animals. Craft torches to scare away wolves. Make spears to throw at prey and protect yourself from apex predators that surround the area.\n\nGiven limited resources, think twice before starting a fight. A bear is a mighty predator and going against one with a knife or even a spear might not be the brightest idea. Maybe avoiding the danger or sneaking past a potential encounter is the smarter choice given the circumstance?\n\nGather resources, learn how to craft all sorts of useful things and build shelters and other structures to escape everyday struggles.\nSome resources are easy to find, some are only available in certain areas, others have to be gained from hunting and some are left behind by those before you.\n\nThe extended crafting system ranges from simple campfires to cook food to building entire shelters and protective structures wherever you please. It is the crafting and building system that will allow you to slowly transition from unbearable danger to a more manageable environment - if you prepare properly.\n\nIt is up to you how you want to play the game and we give you 3 different modes to choose from:\n\nStory Mode: Learn more about yourself and people long gone while you struggle to survive. Find your friends and get back home.\n\nColdwave: Risk your life in an ultimate survival experience. Brave the elements of an ever-changing weather and see how far you can go before the wilderness claims you.\n\nEndless Mode: Take advantage of more resources and crafting options as you try to conquer the world around you.
