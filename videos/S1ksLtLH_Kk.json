{"id": "S1ksLtLH_Kk", "snippet": {"title": "DOOM FIGHTERS - Third Person Mod To Duel a Cyberdemon with Crucible", "description": "DOOM FIGHTERS 0.4B mod, this is a third person modification playable with any WAD or mappack, where you play in third person as a Doomguy using only your fists, legs and Crucible once found against any threats, WAD is Chainworm Kommando. Welcome to the gameplay modification where Doomguy is a really nasty agile, fast and tough tank that can survive lots of beating, even Cyberdemon's rockets because while monsters have their attacks unchanged, you can only use fists and legs. You can also jump and attack with flying kicks or punches, jumping is also really great to avoid enemy projectiles (because while you have no firearms at all, you can at least have a chance to avoid projectiles with jumping). With main attack button you perform quick but lightly damaging series of punches, good to use against bigger monsters because every hit by Doomguy is stunning a monster for a while, so Cyberdemons or Mancubi might not have a chance to attack you. The stronger attacks are performed when you click a secondary attack button, there your punches are slower but stronger, you also do roundkicks from time to time, these attacks can be charged for a while to release one single very powerful blow. These attacks also cover a little bigger area than standard attacks, basically you can damage few enemies at once but at the cost of being exposed to the enemies because of your slow attack speed, very useful tho to take down groups of smaller enemies. Doomguy can also grab the enemies, rotate with them for a while and release them at obstacle/wall/enemy highly damaging or even killing them, but be careful because you can't simply grab bigger demons so easily, they will break free after a while. If you don't want to simply throw them at enemies, you can also punch them to death with your strong jabs, but this type can also make you more vulnerable to the enemies, you are locked in place till finishing the demon. Very rarely (depending on the mappack of course!) you might also find a Crucible that grants you more damage and range when attacking, but like in lots of Arcade Beam'em Up titles, after some time Crucible becomes useless and simply wears down. Doomguy is also way more resilient as I said earlier but such things as armor or Berserk Pack do not exist here, every health/armor bonus simply boosts your Hit Points up to the 200, that's quite a lot because enemy attacks are not so harmful. Before you start playing this modification please remember about binding the keys to both types of attacks, grabbing the enemies, throwing Crucible & barrels, health regeneration, another Doomguy to help etc. etc.\n\n00:00 - MAP06 Budberg Crypts\n04:20 - MAP07 The Portal\n10:35 - MAP08 Dhago'Ba\n15:45 - MAP09 Winterlingen\n27:55 - MAP10 Hellgrinder\n\nMy Discord - https://discord.gg/skpZWagjTJ\nDOOM Fighters - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=73542\nChainsworm Kommando - https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/chnworm\nBFG Division Wolfenstein Remix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gJNwZUGLF0\nGigachad Slayer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=913TRVWQvEM\nThe Slayer's Path - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LR22ukkrVM", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1ksLtLH_Kk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1ksLtLH_Kk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1ksLtLH_Kk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1ksLtLH_Kk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1ksLtLH_Kk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DOOM FIGHTERS - Third Person Mod To Duel a Cyberdemon with Crucible", "description": "DOOM FIGHTERS 0.4B mod, this is a third person modification playable with any WAD or mappack, where you play in third person as a Doomguy using only your fists, legs and Crucible once found against any threats, WAD is Chainworm Kommando.
