Realistic craps with easy to follow instructions for beginners, and all the exciting bets a senior craps player is used to and love! Craps is the fastest-moving of casino table games. An average speed at a busy blackjack table runs around 60 hands per hour, but the house expects about 100 decisions per hour at craps. That, along with the tendency of craps players to have several bets working at once, means that craps requires a larger bankroll than other table games. And craps offers the widest variety of bets in the casino, with dozens of wagering options on the table.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/craps-plus"}
