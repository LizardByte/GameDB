Play through Spore's five evolutionary stages: Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and Space. Each stage has its own unique style, challenges, and goals. You can play how you choose, start in Cell and nurture one species from humble tidepool organism to intergalactic traveler, or jump straight in and build tribes or civilizations on new planets. What you do with your universe is up to you.\n\nSpore gives you a variety of powerful yet easy-to-use creation tools so you can create every aspect of your universe: creatures, vehicles, buildings, and even starships. While Spore is a single-player game, your creations are automatically shared with other players providing a limitless number of worlds to explore and play.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spore-collection", "videos": [{"id": 32318, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "n49CtKgwGGg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n49CtKgwGGg", "title": "SPORE\u2122 Collection - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n49CtKgwGGg/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 352, "name": "Spore"}]}
