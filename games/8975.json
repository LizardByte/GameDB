Additional, a host of new \u2018real world\u2019 transfer clauses have been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club he has just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of money and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. Beyond this, the old \u2018turn-based\u2019 system of transfer negotiations can now be accomplished two ways, the tried and tested system and a new \u2018live\u2019 system, similar to that used in Football Manager\u2019s contract negotiations.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/football-manager-2014"}
