The game takes place in a darkly fantastical world where grotesque plant life and animals roam and harsh societal customs rule. Taking cues from modern survival classics, Smoke and Sacrifice evolves the genre with its intensely personal story and complex ecosystem. Creatures forage, mate, breed and prey on one another, creating a living world. Only by taming the game\u2019s wilds can Sachi hope to unravel the mystery at the heart of Smoke and Sacrifice. \n \nDepicted in a beautiful, hand-painted style, Smoke and Sacrifice\u2019s storybook visuals disguise its brutal story of motherhood and survival. Sachi doesn\u2019t just have to worry about the game\u2019s antagonists - the entire game world poses a threat. Players can alter the behaviour of plant and animal life, but this may also limit the resources Sachi has to craft items from. The deadly smoke also poses unique challenges throughout the game, altering enemy as well as player behaviour.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 18101, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0MbS4i7G0co"}, {"id": 19411, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ka0pwLKlsH4"}]}
