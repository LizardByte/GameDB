And fall it will. But when it does, you can keep the Faith you earned during the run. You can use it to unlock new towers and boost their abilities.\n\nIf you persist, it won't be long before you will unveil the source of enemies. As you reveal the Eye of the Evil, it will go berserk and spawn a torrent of enemies. You will conquer this eye with a free Annihilator tower.\n\nThe enemy offensive is not just limited to attack on the Temple. Some carry corruption trails that infect the towers on the way. When corruption exceeds certain limit, it leads to curses. You must learn to avoid corruption or to mitigate its consequences.", "summary": "Next level in Tower Defense Rogue-like game progression.
