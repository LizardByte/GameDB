Seen a player hanging next to a precarious precipice. One single shot of your gun...and down he goes to his death.\nThere's just something so primal, so simple, so fun about that.\n\nPush is a Last Man Standing gameplay modification replicating exactly that. In Push, your goal is simple: Knock enemies off onto instant-death floors, and stay on the arena as long as possible. Gameplay emphasizes skill and quick reflexes above all else. Get accurate and knock enemies off into pits. Figure out how to survive being thrown into the abyss. Think fast and act faster, and you just might be the last one standing.\nYou're given absolute minimal equipment so you can focus on strategy. Laser guns that do no damage but have extremely high knockback, Primary fire shoots a laser that doesn't do a lot of push, but is very accurate and very, very fast. Secondary fire lobs an energy grenade that has short range and arcs downward, but has massive amounts of knockback and can rocketjump like nothing else. Gauntlets that can send people careening off into the distance with a single (lucky) blow. And a double-jump to help with recovery.\n\nIt's all so simple. So, so simple. And it's short, too--matches barely last any longer than three minutes. Any longer, and drones come in to mop up whatever people remain.\nInterested in some popcorn fun? Interested in pushing people around? Or just interested in trying something different?\nGive it a shot.
