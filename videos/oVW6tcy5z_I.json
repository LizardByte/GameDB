Crush Your Enemies is a RTS distilled down to the basics - foul-mouthed barbarians, gratuitous use of \"bollocks,\" and more chest hair than you can handle.\n\nCrush Your Enemies (http://store.steampowered.com/app/406850/) offers short bursts of brutal mayhem with super-simple controls, an epic single-player campaign, and cross-platform multiplayer. Even better, Crush Your Enemies is overflowing with delightful bloodshed, naughty curse words, and downright weird boss battles, like a giant head-butting Death Snail.\n\nCrush Your Enemies is the second game from Warsaw-based studio, Vile Monarch, and features an original score composed by Marcin Przyby\u0142owicz (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Hard West).\n\nCrush Your Enemies arrives this spring on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n\nFor more information about Crush Your Enemies please visit http://store.steampowered.com/app/406850/ or www.gambitious.com, and follow us on Twitter @VileMonarch", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVW6tcy5z_I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVW6tcy5z_I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVW6tcy5z_I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVW6tcy5z_I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVW6tcy5z_I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Crush Your Enemies - Announcement Trailer", "description": "Strategy games have become too stuffy, bogged down with diplomacy, endless repositioning, waiting....ugh, so much waiting.
