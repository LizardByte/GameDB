You are elite US sniper Karl Fairburne. Parachuted into Berlin amidst the Germans\u2019 final stand, your mission is to prevent Nazi V2 rocket program technology from falling into the hands of the besieging Red Army. You must aid key scientists keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the Russians.\n\nTake advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill, patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race against time. Watch as the celebrated \u2018bullet cam\u2019 from Sniper Elite returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever \u2013 skilful shots are rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are graphically rendered in X-Ray as the bullet enters and destroys your victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact of the sniper\u2019s bullet is brought to life.\n\nAs World War Two ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts.
