Unlock new achievements and earn new rewards including item sets, collectibles, and more as you fight to preserve what little peace remains in the war-torn region of Cyrodiil.\n\nLep Seclusa\n\nThe Moth Priests of Lep Seclusa are besieged, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is set on seizing the power of the Elder Scroll they safeguard. You must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary against an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the power of the scroll to forever change the face of Cyrodiil.\n\nExiled Redoubt\n\nSoldiers of the Alliance War, regardless of their faction, are vanishing, and all trails lead to the Imperial fortress known as the Exiled Redoubt. Team up with the Battlemage Lucilla, infiltrate this mysterious stronghold, and put a stop to the schemes of a once noble Imperial house before its chaos can spread beyond its stone walls and throughout Tamriel.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online-fallen-banners"}
