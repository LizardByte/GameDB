It was officially released to retail on November 2, 2007, with customers that pre-ordered the game allowed access to the live servers from October 30, 2007. The development team released updates, called \"Deployments,\" nearly every month following launch. The game required a monthly subscription.\n\nTabula Rasa was about humanity's last stand against a group of aliens called the Bane. The story took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, which were in a state of constant conflict between the AFS (Allied Free Sentients) and the Bane. The term tabula rasa means \"clean slate\" in Latin, which refers to a fresh start, or starting over.\nAccording to the developers, the game included the ability for players to influence the outcome of a war between the player characters and the NPCs.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tabula-rasa", "videos": [{"id": 16714, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "yIRDqnnI3Bc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIRDqnnI3Bc", "title": "Tabula Rasa PC Games Preview - Richard Garriott Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yIRDqnnI3Bc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16715, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "UDkm0IUW4II", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDkm0IUW4II", "title": "Tabula Rasa PC Games Gameplay - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UDkm0IUW4II/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
