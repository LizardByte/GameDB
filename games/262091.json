This must be done before the \"Bonus\" value reaches zero. To complicate things the \"Painter\" has to avoid any collision with the \"Chasers\", some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The \"Painter\" will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/painter"}
