It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle \u2014 a sentient, disembodied tentacle \u2014 from taking over the world. The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.\n\nDave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company's first title to feature voice acting.\n\nThe game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements. Day of the Tentacle has featured regularly in lists of \"top\" games published more than two decades after its release, and aspects have been referenced in popular culture.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/day-of-the-tentacle", "characters": [{"id": 246, "name": "Dwayne"}, {"id": 6644, "name": "Purple"}, {"id": 6647, "name": "George Washington"}, {"id": 6658, "name": "Zd Edison"}, {"id": 6663, "name": "Zedna Edison"}, {"id": 6642, "name": "Bernard"}, {"id": 6646, "name": "Doctor Tentacle"}, {"id": 6654, "name": "Man in Sky Mask"}, {"id": 6652, "name": "Zed Edison"}, {"id": 6662, "name": "Edna Edison"}, {"id": 6659, "name": "Ben Franklin"}, {"id": 6661, "name": "Thomas Jefferson"}, {"id": 6653, "name": "John Hancock"}, {"id": 6650, "name": "Doctor Fred Edison"}, {"id": 6657, "name": "Ed Edison"}, {"id": 6660, "name": "Cigar Salesman"}, {"id": 6648, "name": "Laverne"}, {"id": 6649, "name": "Irish Maid"}, {"id": 6656, "name": "Nurse Edna"}, {"id": 6655, "name": "Betsy Ross"}, {"id": 6645, "name": "Green"}, {"id": 6651, "name": "Doctor Red Edison"}, {"id": 6643, "name": "Hoagie"}]}
