Spanning regret, reconciliation and redemption, it's a bittersweet story that's both deeply personal, and undeniably universal.\n\nReleased in partnership with Cyan Ventures, the new publishing arm from the creators of the legendary games Myst and Riven, ZED is the vision of Chuck Carter, part of the team behind the original Myst. Co-written by Joe Fielder (Bioshock Infinite, The Flame and the Flood) and David Chen (Metal Gear Solid series, Narcosis), the game also features a riveting performance from veteran video-game voice actor Stephen Russell (the Thief and Fallout series).", "summary": "Revelation, regret and redemption in the twilight dreams of an aging artist.
