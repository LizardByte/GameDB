The game is played in two camera angles: the player moves from a third-person perspective while walking, which changes to a first-person perspective while aiming the gun. You'll pick up several guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle. But like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently and ammo can be very scarce.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 73462, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "--tL-EM4IHc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tL-EM4IHc", "title": "PS2 Longplay [098] Resident Evil: Dead Aim (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/--tL-EM4IHc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
