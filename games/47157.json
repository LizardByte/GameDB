You are Harold, a young lab assistant for the ship\u2019s lead scientist, Jeanne Mareaux. While most of the ship\u2019s inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life lived aboard the sunken ship, Mareaux still works tirelessly to find a way for the ship to leave the planet and find a new, dryer home.\n\nBut of course the weird, wonderful and diverse people of the Fedora keep Harold busy too. Until one fateful encounter plunges Harold into a new world that nobody could have guessed existed - and one that may hold the key to Mareaux\u2019s re-launch plans.\n\nJoin Harold as he explores a vibrant retro-future world, talks (with full voice acting) to its inhabitants, and occasionally goes hands on by sticking screwdrivers in things, operating complex machinery, and more in his quest to find the true meaning of \u2018home\u2019.", "summary": "Dive into this nautic adventure as curiosity will guide you through a space ship wreck on an unknown planet made up of water. When one of the lead scientists still on board tries to unriddle the possibility of a relaunch young Janitor Harold is around to assist her. Join Harold in his clumsy undertakings to stir up the ark-like ship\u2019s stale day-to-day life and find the secrets that lie behind its doors.\n\nUnderwater atmosphere, self-reflective humor and contemporary adventure mechanics make up the foundation of this game created entirely out of craft supplies.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 14862, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "_H0vrG1PMGA"}, {"id": 14863, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nbejfDVg73c"}, {"id": 14864, "name": "Kickstarter pitch trailer", "video_id": "7bkaEAt2afs"}]}
