In this game, the players cannot move except for the goal keeper. The ball on the hand, gets attracted to the nearest player. Players must then shoot the ball like a rubber band and try to get a good angle for a shot. Take control of the goal keeper by pressing and holding down the Shift Key. The goal of the game is to outscore your opponent before the match is over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elastic-soccer", "videos": [{"id": 134229, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "T23ig0T3Xc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T23ig0T3Xc0", "title": "Elastic Soccer (PC browser game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T23ig0T3Xc0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
