Armed with the mark of the Outsider and powerful new supernatural abilities, hunt down your enemies and forever alter the fate of the Empire.", "summary": "Dishonored 2 is a first-person action video game and the sequel to Dishonored. It borrows many of the gameplay elements from the first opus: players define their own play style by blending action, assassination, stealth, mobility and combat. Combining tools at their disposal, players are allowed options to eliminate enemies, whether they choose to pursue them unseen or ruthlessly attack head on. Dishonored 2 features the same campaign style as its predecessor in which the protagonist must advance through a series of missions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dishonored-2-steelbook-edition", "videos": [{"id": 119687, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yoMVgZGW0WI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoMVgZGW0WI", "title": "Dishonored 2: Das Verm\u00e4chtnis der Maske - Launch-Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yoMVgZGW0WI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
