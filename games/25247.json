Adjust your bike's gear-ratio settings, transmission, and tire composition before competing against seven computer-controlled riders in either a single race or a 13-event tournament. Individual practice and training sessions allow you to learn each track's layout and optimal racing lines prior to the event. View the action from a first-person perspective behind the bike's handlebars or from a third-person vantage point. Six difficulty levels and various other customization settings let you determine the degree of realism on each course. You can also challenge a friend to a head-to-head race via split-screen display.\n\nallgames", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}]}
