This hack features a single cave floor that has EVERY single object in the game at once, in a massive expanse with billions of possible layouts for you to explore. Every boss, every treasure, every cave, its all right here. You can play through it with up to 4 players as well!\n\nIt also features a character select screen with 48 different characters that anyone can play as, options for 200 pikmin limit, onions in the cave, manual cave layout seeds, choosing the cave song, and much more!\n\nI must note that unlike my other pikmin 2 hacks, this one will not be compatible with actual hardware, as the original point of the hack was to show off the power of extra ram with Dolphin Emulator. While the hack has grown to be much more now, it's still always going to need extra ram. The included readme has instructions on how to get extra ram working.\n\nDownload this and all my other projects from here:\nhttps://pikhacker.github.io/\n\nAdditionally I highly recommend you join my discord server to talk about this hack, getting it set up, or organizing playing it with others.\nhttps://discord.gg/WHSaSS5", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q38kIPFPjtY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q38kIPFPjtY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q38kIPFPjtY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pikmin 2 - Colossal Caverns", "description": "NOTE: this video is outdated now as version colossal caverns is currently at version 2.1 with a newer video showing it off\nMy next major Pikmin romhack, and the first since 251 to have truly new gameplay, its the Colossal Caverns!
