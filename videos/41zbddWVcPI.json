{"id": "41zbddWVcPI", "snippet": {"title": "Retro Atari Classics - Nintendo DS Gameplay", "description": "Also known in Japan as \"Atarimix Happy 10 Games\", Atari teamed up with popular graffiti artists REAS, Delta and Obey Giant to create remixed versions of the classic arcade games via new \"Tagged\" mode. Released way back in 2005, this was developed by Taniko and it was meant to take advantage of the DS touchscreen. It was especially good for games like PONG and Breakout... though not exactly practical for the rest.\n\nThe game had garnered a 51 out of the overall 100 on Metacritic, with the ONLY positive review coming from the May 2005 issue of Game Informer which, according to Metacritic, gave it an 80. The rest of the reviews from critics were mostly mixed to negative, with 7 mixed and 9 negative out of the 17 reviews. The lowest score came from PALGN, who gave it a 20/100, calling it \"an outright travesty\". Game Chronicles, who gave it a 55/100, had this to say: \"While this game is not destined for a New Mexico landfill, it is also not destined to be a centerpiece in your DS collection. At least we\u2019ve learned that when Atari falls, they always seem to come back. Hopefully next time they will hit the mark.\"\n\nWell, what do you think of this compilation? While it wasn't the only Atari compilation on the DS, we still had to wait until 2010 and 2011 for Code Mystics to make a bigger, better compilation. So this was the closest we could get for an Atari collection for the DS at the time.\n\nGames in this collection:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:17 - Asteroids\n03:58 - Breakout\n08:27 - Centipede\n10:28 - Gravitar\n13:54 - Lunar Lander\n18:34 - Missile Command\n21:58 - PONG\n27:53 - Sprint\n31:11 - Tempest\n32:44 - Warlords\n\nRetro Atari Classics, Asteroids, Breakout, Centipede, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Missile Command, PONG, Sprint, Tempest, Warlords (C) Atari SA\nDeveloped by Taniko\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #atari #retroatariclassics #nintendo #nintendods #nds #reas #delta #obeygiant #graffiti #grafittiart #asteroids #breakout #centipede #gravitar #lunarlander #missilecommand #pong #sprint #tempest #warlords", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41zbddWVcPI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41zbddWVcPI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41zbddWVcPI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41zbddWVcPI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41zbddWVcPI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Retro Atari Classics - Nintendo DS Gameplay", "description": "Also known in Japan as \"Atarimix Happy 10 Games\", Atari teamed up with popular graffiti artists REAS, Delta and Obey Giant to create remixed versions of the classic arcade games via new \"Tagged\" mode.
