When Bomberman was re-released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, a story was incorporated into the gameplay.\nIn the NES version of Bomberman, the title character grows tired of making bombs in an underground factory in the Bungeling Empire. Bomberman finds out that if a robot is able to reach the surface, it can become human. The title character decides to escape, and is turned into an organic human being known as the \"Runner\".", "summary": "Bomberman is a robot engaged in the production of bombs. Like his fellow robots, he had been put to work in an underground compound by evil forces. Bomberman found it to be an unbearably dreary existence. One day, he heard an encouraging rumor. According to the rumor, any robot that could escape the underground compound and make it to the surface could become human. Bomberman leaped at the opportunity, but escape proved to be no small task. Alerted to Bomberman's betrayal, large numbers of the enemy set out in pursuit. Bomberman can rely only on bombs of his own production for his defense. Will he ever make it up to the surface? Once there, will he really become human?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman", "videos": [{"id": 15353, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "mKIOVwqgSXM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKIOVwqgSXM", "title": "Bomberman (Hudson Soft, 1989) - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mKIOVwqgSXM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118187, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DIfud5T9i9s"}], "collections": [{"id": 549, "name": "Bomberman"}]}
