It is an 11-map sequel episode to Project Einherjar, released a year earlier: both projects are based on a dystopian novel series, Last of the Ghost Lions, set in the same universe. The gameplay involves lots of fast, brutal shootouts with enemies that die relatively easily, but can badly injure the careless player. Midgard Outlaw uses the same weapons and enemies from Project Einherjar, but adds several new foes, as well as a dynamic music gimmick: the soundtrack is comprised of ogg vorbis instead of midi, and switches from calm to intense at certain points during each mission. Unlike its sci-fi heavy predecessor, Midgard Outlaw has almost no sci-fi elements apart from the dystopian setting, focusing on an action movie motif instead. It also features a secret level, unlike the original.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midgard-outlaw", "videos": [{"id": 68150, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "k2pRpryJvRY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2pRpryJvRY", "title": "Midgard Outlaw - Full Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k2pRpryJvRY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 68151, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IqRXu325F48", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqRXu325F48", "title": "Midgard Outlaw Trailer 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqRXu325F48/sddefault.jpg"}]}
