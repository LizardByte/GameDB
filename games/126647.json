One day the queen gave birth to a child who would change everything. they named her Laura. And the very happy king celebrated Laura's birth with a big party.\n\nYears passed and one day the king learned that a trio of murderous thieves were entering the village's houses. The king immediately strengthened the guard in these regions so that the guards would protect the people of this trio.\n\nAs a result, the castle's guard became smaller. thieves invaded the castle. They were confused, so two of them were caught and the other took the queen's daughter hostage in one of the rooms. As time passed, Laura did not show fear or despair at the hands of the bandit, but she felt very angry.\n\nWhen he looked at her, he noticed that a white light emanated from her body. Out of fear, the thief released her from his hands, but she didn't fall, she remained floating in the air.\n\nThe thief became desperate and climbed out the window and climbed the columns of the castle to another window where the king and queen's bedroom was.\n\nThe king, wanting to protect the queen, reacted and went after the thief.\n\nThe thief quickly drew the knife from his waist and stabbed the king.\n\nThe queen, upon witnessing the king's death, became very angry and grabbed the thief, pushing him towards the window, and accidentally fell with him.\n\nAs the day went by, Laura was at her parents' funeral, crying, she began to notice that she was different from other people. So upon returning to the castle, she decided to try to control her powers.\n\nIt didn't take her long to learn, as she was very committed to it, seeing that she could fly just by concentrating, she soon managed to master her powers.\n\nBut one day, the villagers found out and many of them left. Those who stayed noticed that she was not using her powers for evil, so they accepted and called these powers witchcraft and affectionately called her little witch Laura.\n\nOver the years, Laura got married and had three daughters. Two were born with the same powers as hers, but the other was born with the power to control fire. She could create several magical flames.\n\nOver the years Laura became much more powerful, and seeing that her time was coming to an end she decided to write her knowledge in Six books, and put a magic in them that only witches could read.\n\nOver time, Laura died, leaving her daughters Lucy, Luna and Sophia, but Luna and Sophia did not get along with Lucy, as she used her powers to do evil to others. Lucy got married and gave birth to a girl named Sandra, and a boy named Leandro. And seeing that her sisters would hinder her goals, she decided to abandon the castle.\n\nTime passed and Sophia got married and had two girls, one was born very powerful and she named her Solarys, but the other didn't seem to be a witch, Sophia named her Luana.\n\nSolarys couldn't feel any power coming from Luana and even doubted whether she was really a witch. Sophia explained to Solarys that to feel the power of a witch you need to be stronger than her or have a minimal difference in power, this made Solarys wonder if Luana was really stronger than her, as apparently it didn't seem like it.", "summary": "Two wizards plan to perform a ritual to revive witch Laura, who died thousands of years ago but must sacrifice a witch in the ritual, so one day Luana and Solarys decide to sledge away from the castle and the witches kidnap Luana's sister to sacrifice her and make Luana unconscious in the woods, her dragon friend wakes her up and the two", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-witch-luana", "videos": [{"id": 103536, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-b1x6QA2y20", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b1x6QA2y20", "title": "Little Witch Luana Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-b1x6QA2y20/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
