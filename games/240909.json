It is believed that 50 years from now a discovery will be made that will change mankind forever - the key to eternal life. The Doc wants to bring eternal life to the present, and make himself the most powerful person who's ever lived.\n\nOne of The Doc's scientists - Dr. Hoff, believes that commiting such actions will lead to the destruction of mankind, and has gone rogue. To avoid getting himself killed, he has hatched a plan to stop The Doc, and shut down the whole facility.\n\nHe has reprogrammed J-727 Mark II (Jay), the facility's mainframe AI computer - to become hostile to The Doc, and free all human experimentation patients. One of them being Patient #84, who was selected for time travel experimentation a few weeks back. In exchange for freedom, he must help with the plan.\n\nThe time machine prototype can only go to the past, but with the power of several Time Crystals, one can go to the future, so to stop The Doc, Patient #84 must travel to the past and collect the Time Crystals before The Doc's enforcers do.\n\nThe first stop is a mining facility in the middle of North America in 1932, in an ancient temple of a serpent water god.", "summary": "TimeWarp is a Xash-powered standalone cartoony HL1 total conversion mod set somewhere in the future where time travel became possible.\n\nPlay as Patient #84, a prisoner of the Advanced Engineering Corporation (AEC), on a quest to put its entire facility out of commission with the help of a mainframe AI gone rogue, while travelling through time along the way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/timewarp", "videos": [{"id": 123596, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "aLF2CMW5Rbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLF2CMW5Rbs", "title": "TimeWarp: City Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aLF2CMW5Rbs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123597, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "d7fpQTnl9WI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7fpQTnl9WI", "title": "TimeWarp - City Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d7fpQTnl9WI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
