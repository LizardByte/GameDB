In this early adventure they travel to a small mountain village, meet strange characters, and solve the mystery of the Light from Prism Peak.\n\nDream Frontier is a turn-based role playing game inspired by Earthbound and 90\u2019s SquareSoft RPGs. Players control a party of three characters, explore a colorful overworld, talk with characters in directed cutscenes, and engage with enemies in a simple combat system.\nEncounters!\n\nEncounter gameplay sticks to the basics of the genre with a few twists. Health is a \u201crolling counter\u201d that doesn\u2019t change instantly, giving the player time to act during a turn before it is drained. Each character has their own specialization and abilities that encourage varied play styles along with a unique Encore. The Encore system lets the characters build energy over an encounter and unleash a large psychic power.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dream-frontier"}
