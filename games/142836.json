Compete in championship mode on different tracks, located and designed throughout the entire USA. Drive from north to south, from the coast to the highest peaks. Win the gold cup and raise it over your head at each of them. Any experienced driver can mess up and cause an accident. But don't worry! because you have the option \u00ac\u00b4 flashback \u00ac\u00aa, which turns back the clock to just before the accident for a new chance, and it's all done in slow motion (bullet time). With several weather settings, each race will always feel different at all times. In training mode, you can practice on an oval circuit with the vehicles that have already been unlocked. Get the best times in the time trial mode and upload them to the world ranking. The challenge is to be number 1 on the world podium among your colleagues, friends or family. Burn! SuperTrucks offers you a passionate and extreme driving experience, with incredible skids and dizzying jumps, where your adrenaline will be through the roof at all times. But don't forget! You yourself are your worst rival.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burn-supertrucks"}
