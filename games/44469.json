To achieve this rank, Keyblade Apprentices must take the Mark of Mastery exam once they come of age. Terra and Aqua take this test together and in the first round Master Xehanort sabotages the exam, forcing Ventus to intervene. In the second round Terra and Aqua fight each other, but while Aqua passes the test, Terra is deemed unfit to become a Keyblade Master due to the abundant darkness in his heart.\n\nAfterward, a group of mysterious creatures called the Unversed begin to surface in other worlds, and another Keyblade Master, Xehanort, disappears without a trace. Terra is sent to destroy the Unversed and find Master Xehanort, who had earlier encouraged him to embrace the darkness in his heart if he desires the strength to become a Keyblade master. Ven, meanwhile, is goaded into following Terra by Xehanort's mysterious apprentice Vanitas, against Eraqus's wishes. Aqua is dispatched by Eraqus to survey Terra and keep him from falling into darkness, as well as to bring Ventus back to the Land of Departure.", "summary": "As well as a copy of the game for PSP, there are two exclusive items that you\u2019ll also get in this version:\n\nTwo KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep art prints.\nA 48-page hardback artwork book entitled \u201cThe Art of KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep\u201d.\n\nThe Special Edition was distributed in UK, France, Germany/Austria/Switzerland, Nordic countries, Benelux, Spain, Italy, Australia/New Zealand, Russia, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep-special-edition", "videos": [{"id": 38293, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "q1nJQfOjq9A"}, {"id": 38294, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xhTM4dhwfpw"}]}
