The librarian, who is voiced by Shunji Fujimura, asks you to finish all of the unfinished picture books that were handled. There are five Pokepi that will appear throughout the stories you help finish: Toro, Suzuki, Jun, Pierre, and Ricky.\n\nThere will also be about 10 people that will show up, who you can also choose the names of. When you start a story, there will be blank spaces, which is where you can change the pictures and the words.\n\nThere's more then 40 books to customize within the game, so it will take a while to complete. You can also redo a picture book you have already done. There are secret books that you can only access using a password that is only shown on anniversaries of Toro and Doko Demo Issyo.", "summary": "Doko Demo Issho: My Picture Book is a video game developed by BeXide and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.\n\nIt was released in April 24, 2003 on the PlayStation 2.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doko-demo-issyo-watashi-na-ehon", "videos": [{"id": 87638, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Oyt9zrVOl6s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyt9zrVOl6s", "title": "PS2 \u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3063\u3057\u3087 \u79c1\u306a\u3048\u307b\u3093 \uff08\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\uff5e\u7d75\u672c\u4f5c\u6210\uff09", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oyt9zrVOl6s/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3737, "name": "Doko Demo Issho"}]}
