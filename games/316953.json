Deep in the heart of a forsaken lake, where the waters run dark and still, lies a twisted game of fate and peril. A fisherman's tale, once filled with dreams of bountiful catch, turned sinister by the unknown.\n\nCatch fish and journey to the enigmatic market, hidden far to the west, shrouded in darkness and secrecy. There, an unworldly buyer awaits, inscrutable and foreboding. Be wary, for the coins that burst forth in the market's belly are no mere trinkets but carry a haunting aura of evil.\n\nYet, as you brave this treacherous path, beware the malevolence that lurks unseen. For in the shadows of ancient trees, treehuggers skulk, eager to snatch your hard-earned catch and curse you with a darkness that spreads through your very being. My skin, once tanned by the sun, now turns black like theirs, a mark of doom that lingers. We are them.\n\nI implore you, weary traveler, to wield caution and wit, for the lake's dark secrets have claimed countless fishermen before you. Their dreams of riches and glory swallowed whole by the lake's insatiable hunger. Tread lightly, for it thirsts for more souls to claim, entangling its victims in an eternal struggle.\n\nYour journey's end beckons in the shop beyond, far to the east. Procure the enigmatic items it holds, and only then may you dare to hope for liberation - to \"release him.\" But I beg you, heed my warning and break the cycle of this wicked game. Turn back, return to the safety of your home shores, and forsake the haunting allure of this macabre endeavor. Your life, your soul, they are precious, and this game is nothing but a cruel, treacherous ruse.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fishing-for-a-god"}
