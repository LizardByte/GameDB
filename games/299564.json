In this game, however, the protagonist was a strange cross between a dolphin and a bird. Speaking with the animal it was possible to became his friend, feed him and explore the world.\nFor many it will be a shocking news, but \u201cTeo\u201d is not the name of the dolphin / bird, but of the planet where he is living. Known under the title \u201cFinFin on Teo, the Magic Planet\u201d, the virtual puppy FinFin made his first appearance on a PC game released in 1996. According to the producers, the 64DD version was not a porting, but a completely new game. The development of Teo for 64DD was probably stopped because of the failure of the Disk Drive, and it is likely that we will never know how different the 64DD game was supposed to be.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/teo-64", "collections": [{"id": 9873, "name": "Fin Fin"}]}
