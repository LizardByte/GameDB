The gems were very important and the lifeblood of the residents of this place, which happened to be the Sugar Fairies. The sweet, yet powerful Sugar Fairies fiercely guarded the gems, as their very existence was inside the gems.\nHowever, one day a curious young fairy was experimenting with a magical spell on a dragon and a rock when she became distracted, and something went terribly wrong. The dragon and rock spell formed new creatures called Krocos. The Krocos would soon become the enemies of the sweet Sugar Fairies, because they too desired to have all the gems. With one taste of the delicious coveted gems, the Krocos have wanted to eat all the gems, and have relentlessly sought their beloved morsels. Ever since then, the Sugar Fairies have been guarding and keeping the gems from the Krocos.", "summary": "Help the starving Krocos remove all the blocks and reach their scrumptious, large, shiny and colorful gem morsels!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragngems"}
