Not literally, though. Just in case you were worried.\n\nFollow Ribby Croaks, an altruistic girl on an emotional journey to get back to her hometown after being ditched in a swamp by some school bullies. Along the way you'll meet tons of potential buddies that have their own problems and issues to work through, but just can't seem to on their own.
