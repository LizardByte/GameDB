Manage the turrets, upgrade and be careful where you put them... Every decision can be fatal. Watch out for the air units, they have a different route!\n\nShred your enemies into pieces with different turret models - from simple guns to Tesla towers - in a battle against both land and airborne units that will do everything to get behind your lines of defence. Featuring real 3D environment and delivering a large number of original levels, War In A Box: Paper Tanks is as addictive as it is simple to play."}
