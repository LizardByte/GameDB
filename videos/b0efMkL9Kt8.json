Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.\n\nMany games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay. Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The distinction is that the gameplay of a card game primarily depends on the use of the cards by players (the board is simply a guide for scorekeeping or for card placement), while board games (the principal non-card game genre to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board, and use the cards for some secondary purpose.\n\nPoker is a family of card games that share betting rules and usually (but not always) hand rankings. Poker games differ in how the cards are dealt, how hands may be formed, whether the high or low hand wins the pot in a showdown (in some games, the pot is split between the high and low hands), limits on bet sizes, and how many rounds of betting are allowed.\n\nBlackjack, also known as Twenty-one or Vingt-et-un, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card game played with one or more French decks of 52 cards. The player draws cards to an initial two card hand with the object of bringing the total hand value as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it, so that the house, which plays after the player, will stop short of the player's total, or will lose by exceeding 21. Many rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly.\n\nSimple 1500 Series vol.007 - The Card is a collection of cards games (like Poker, Blackjack, etc) that features 3 different boards and backgrounds.\n\nSimple Series (C) D3Publisher\nPublished by Culture Publishers (later re-release published by D3Publisher)\nDeveloped by Success\nBIOS Used: Polymega BIOS\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #polymega #polymegagameplays #ps1 #psx #psone #playstation #simple1500 #simpleseries #simple #d3publisher #thecard #poker #blackjack", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0efMkL9Kt8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0efMkL9Kt8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0efMkL9Kt8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0efMkL9Kt8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0efMkL9Kt8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Polymega Gameplays - Simple 1500 Series: Vol.07 - The Card [PlayStation - Japan]", "description": "A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific.
