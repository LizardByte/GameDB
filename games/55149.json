Beasts, giants, and the undead wage war on all living creatures while the gods fail to end Ragnarok. Thor, with his mighty hammer, was powerless as ice and fire spread across the fields of Midgard.\n\nFreya, and her falcon suit, were unable to prevent the giants from destroying innocent villages. Hel\u2019s army was no match for the terrible beasts that crossed their path, and Asgard\u2019s most cunning god, Loki, couldn\u2019t outwit the onslaught of venomous beasts.\n\nNot even Odin, one of the wisest and most powerful gods, could stop Ragnarok from spreading like a plague through these once-fruitful lands. Soon, humanity will perish under the weight of the war.\n\nNow, mankind must rise and do what the gods could not. Ragnarok must end.", "summary": "Inspired by the original Rune (2000), Rune II is set in a dangerous Norse universe during Ragnarok, the end of days, where beasts and the last remaining humans alike struggle to survive.\n\nYou have been chosen by the gods to be Midgard\u2019s savior - receive their blessings and powerful abilities as you endeavor to end Ragnarok!
