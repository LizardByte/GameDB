The annual Living World Challenge Cup Race is due to start and all the contestants are fully geared up to race around the track and take the coveted Cup home.\nEach character individually races in powerful fan-propelled hover boats and can reach lightening fast speeds under turbo boost, whizzing around tracks, collecting the various speed-ups and nutritional snack points along the way.
