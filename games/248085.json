History tells us that magic itself originated within its walls and that the castle was not built, but that it appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. Ever since its existence, the castle has granted individuals the gift of magic by surviving its challenge and completing its quest. What initially started as Earlwind\u2019s community of followers has since grown to become a sizable village of scholars and challengers.\n\nEvery year, people from all walks of life flock to Blackwater Village, to devote their lives to study the profound history of the castle and its secrets. Their ultimate goal is to overcome the castle's challenge and be granted the gifts of magic. Occasionally, a group of students will band together to form a temporary alliance. Together they will enter the castle and attempt its quest, knowing that failure results in death.", "summary": "Castle of Blackwater is a 2D, action-packed, social deduction game with a magical twist.\n\nIn this intense game of trust and betrayal, up to 10 strangers are trapped in a castle of danger and deception, with a mission to complete tasks and escape with their lives. Some will work together, forming bonds and strong alliances. Others will pretend and deceive, with their own interests at heart.\n\nEach player will receive a unique role, belonging to one of three factions, with abilities to support their playstyle. Using these special powers, as well as their own deductive reasoning, players must uncover those working against them before getting eliminated themselves.\n\nAlive players can utilize many of the in-game tools to help them put together the pieces of the puzzle. Dead players will have the opportunity to collect and spend souls, buying mighty power-ups that can help turn the tide for their team from beyond the grave.\n\nIn the ever-lasting battle between good and evil, only one side will survive to claim the Castle\u2019s victory.\n\nWhen lives are at stake and the truth has no meaning,\n\nWho will you trust?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-of-blackwater", "videos": [{"id": 138514, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "dUPPW4L6B_Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPPW4L6B_Q", "title": "Official Gameplay Trailer 2025 l Castle of Blackwater", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dUPPW4L6B_Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
