Together with Flo, Quinn and the rest of the DinerTown residents, they started their soap opera project.", "summary": "Soap Opera Dash is a spin-off dash game starring Rosie the Regular whom was previously the basic customer of Diner Dash.\n\nEach episode is divided into a few scenes, and actors of a particular scene will appear at the chairs accordingly. Actors will need to read the script and move to stations to get their hair and makeup done, along with a change of costume. When all the necessary steps are done, they will be ready on the set for their shoot. However, their needs must be tended to quickly since their mood (indicated by the number of hearts) will fade and will affect the quality of the scene. Players will run a risk of losing a scene if one of the required actors left with a bad mood on set.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soap-opera-dash"}
