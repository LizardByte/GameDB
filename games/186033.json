A true successor to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, with none of the death!\n\nBut, the truth is, Fritz didn't build The Popgoes Pizzeria for customers. He built it for himself. And as a night guard for the place, you're a part of it. So, let's get started. Let's help Fritz out.", "summary": "Popgoes is a Five Nights at Freddy's fan-game.
