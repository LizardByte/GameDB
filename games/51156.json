Fire lasers and blue pellets at a steady wave of fruit and vegetable creatures, causing the personified food to explode in a bright burst. The depiction is mostly whimsical, though you do see their \"kill percentage\" tallied on menu screens at the end of each round. Game customized for each target platform.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/veggy-world"}
