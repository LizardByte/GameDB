The game is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 9324, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "UBHJhla8TO4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBHJhla8TO4", "title": "Arcade Longplay [499] Donkey Kong", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UBHJhla8TO4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
