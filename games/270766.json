As these rocks melt, ice monsters hatch from them and track you down. Your only defense is to push a block of ice rock, sending it crashing into the monsters. The monsters can also push and break through ice rocks, and ice rocks can be destroyed by hitting them against another rock or against the side of the labyrinth.\n\nThe vehicle has limited fuel, and a buzzer will ring when the machine is low. The truck can be refueled by crushing a diamond ore rock. The player has a total of 3 lives, and there are always 2 enemies per stage. There are 8 levels of difficulty.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/block-buster--6", "videos": [{"id": 99463, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LQ6kN4-lAPY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ6kN4-lAPY", "title": "Block Buster - VIC-20 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LQ6kN4-lAPY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
