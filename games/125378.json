She performed errands for the other Ga-Matoran and spoke with Nixie, who showed her a formula to find coordinates based on the six Toa. Nokama, recently returned from a Turaga meeting, announced the villages would hold a Kolhii Tournament, and chose Hahli over Kotu to play for Ga-Koro, with Macku as her defense player. While talking with the other Ga-Matoran, Hahli received the Charm from Shasa representing Unity, the Speed Charm from Kai, and the Purity Charm from Marka. Pelagia took Hahli into Naho Bay to swim with a Takea to improve her Speed. When Onepu and Taipu came to play the Ga-Matoran, Hahli used her Speed to get the better of the team. The Onu-Matoran invited her to Onu-Koro, where she explored the Marn Tunnels. After diving in the now flooded Great Mine to recover mining equipment, she helped Azibo recover his Sluice, and he gave Hahli the Prosperity Charm in return. Taipu trained Hahli in the Onu-Matoran discipline of Stamina and gave her its Charm. Hahli also met Nuparu, who gave her fitness check-ups.\n\nHahli had to go to Ko-Koro for the approaching Kolhii match. While exploring, she met Jaatikko and Toudo, who gave her the Destiny Charm and Peace Charm, respectively. Hahli traversed The Drifts and found Kantai, who trained her in Willpower and gave her its Charm. Using Willpower and Stamina, Hahli defeated Matoro and Kopeke in the match. Arriving in Le-Koro, Hahli was greeted by Kongu and Matau and found the Faith Charm. During training in Accuracy with Bamboo Disks under Tamaru, Hahli found the Accuracy Charm. Using her improved Accuracy, Hahli won the match against Kongu and Tamaru, and left for Po-Koro. In Po-Koro, she learned about Creation from Hewkii and found its Charm. She practiced in Strategy with Golyo by herding Mahi and also found its Charm. In the subsequent match, she used her new skills to defeat Hafu and Hewkii. Leaving the village, she travelled to Ta-Koro to play Jaller and Takua, and Jaller directed her to Keahi to train in Strength. After learning about the last Principle of Courage from Kapura, she used her full knowledge of the Skills and Principles to defeat Ta-Koro, securing a spot in the Championship.\n\nIn the Championship, the Ga-Koro team played against Po-Koro and Ta-Koro at the Ta-Koro Kolhii Stadium, and Hahli and Macku won narrowly. At the end of the game, the Mask of Light slipped out of Jaller's bag, leading the Turaga to proclaim Jaller the herald of the Seventh Toa and set him upon a quest. Hahli wanted to speak to Jaller, but he had to leave quickly on his quest. Trying to find him, she found the Courage Charm in Jaller's home the and Duty Charm at the Wall of History. She returned to Ga-Koro and looked at the formula Nixie had showed her. Because of the announcement of the Seventh Toa, she used seven as the base number instead six, calculating a coordinate in Naho Bay. Pelagia sailed her to the coordinate, and Hahli found the Temple of Purity in the ocean She located the Crystal of Purity deep in the ocean, and unlocked its Temple with the Charms. After showing the Crystal to Nixie, Hahli went to find the other temples. In Onu-Koro, Hahli swam again in the Great Mine, diving to the bottom to find the Temple of Prosperity. Unlocking it, she retrieved the Crystal of Prosperity and swam back up to the surface. The Drifts contained the Temple of Peace, a grouping of three statues Hahli unlocked to reveal another Crystal. In Le-Wahi, the highest tree-top contained the Temple of Faith, and using Charms she retrieved the Crystal of Faith. The Temple of Creation was a statue half covered in sand in Po-Wahi, that Hahli entered to retrieve the Crystal of Creation. With five Crystals, Hahli returned to Ta-Koro to look for the final Temple, Charm, and Crystal.\n\nArrival of the Rahkshi\n\nHahli unlocking the Crystal's secret\nThree Rahkshi suddenly attacked Ta-Koro, but Hahli was able to raise the bridge so the Matoran could escape. Confronted by Lerahk, she fled Ta-Koro as it was destroyed and ran into Ta-Wahi. Hahli stumbled upon the Temple of Courage and found Courage's Charm. Using it to enter the Temple, she found the last Crystal. Wandering the Ta-Wahi Beach, Hahli found the Great Telescope and a carving of The Legend of Mata Nui. Noticing slots in the carving, Hahli inserted the Crystals, and was teleported to Kini-Nui where she watched as three more Rahkshi flew overhead.\n\nWhen Jaller died and Takua transformed into Takanuva, Hahli mourned Jaller deeply. Once the Toa built the Ussanui, she placed his mask upon the helm to lead Takanuva to victory and a new light. She then hid in the Ussanui and traveled with Takanuva into Mangaia for his conflict with Makuta Teridax. There, Takanuva sent her to bring the other Turaga and Toa Nuva from the surface. This incited quarreling among the islanders, whom Hahli quieted with a hopeful speech about Jaller and the Three Virtues. After Takanuva defeated Teridax and transformed with him into Takutanuva, he lifted the gate for the Matoran. When Hahli ran by with Jaller's mask, Takutanuva stopped her and gave up part of his life force to bring Jaller back to life. Takutanuva then perished, and Takanuva emerged from the rubble of the gate.\n\nHahli was given the position of Chronicler by Nokama, and was one of a handful of Matoran who witnessed the Turaga tell the tales of their adventures as Toa Metru and Toa Hordika, recording the legends in her position as Chronicler.", "summary": "Hahli, a shy Ga-Matoran flax maker travels around the island of Mata Nui to prepare for her big game at the Kolhii Championship.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 31145, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "70b21zh3Gag"}]}
