We noticed the lack of focus on the gaming experience itself in the current blockchain gaming landscape. Many games prioritize monetization over gameplay, but we're here to change that. Our main goal is to captivate our audience with an awe-inspiring storyline that draws players in and keeps them hooked. Coupled with hyper-realistic graphics and a breathtaking world filled with wonders and discoveries, we're aiming for that \"WOW effect\" that leaves players truly amazed.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic universe, players can choose from various roles like warriors, traders, and explorers, each with unique abilities and skills.\n\nYou assume the role of Echo, a courageous warrior driven by a quest for truth and freedom. The game allows players to freely explore diverse landscapes, from lush forests and towering mountains to sprawling cities and ancient ruins. Discover hidden secrets, uncover hidden civilizations, and interact with various characters that inhabit the world.", "summary": "Echo of the Horizon (EOTH) is an open-world RPG built in Unreal Engine 5, featuring single-player and multiplayer modes.
