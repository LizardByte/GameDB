For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life.\n\nYou are Hayward Generation VII 81363-7, a corpse swathed in iron and arcane. Though a newer model, you are no guest to the Strange and a formidable veteran of its wilds.\n\nRecently, the Great Strange has begun to rapidly expand- its phenomena intensifying to an unseen degree. Current leads suggest the involvement of Hayward Generation I \"Avlan\", whose disappearance synchronizes with the Strange\u2019s sudden proliferation.\n\nMission Objective: Enter the mining village of Kozanoda where Avlan was last spotted and apprehend the missing Gen I.\n\nUse of lethal force is authorized. Use of paranormal apparatus is authorized. Exercise extreme caution when confronting Avlan. Minimize injuries to civilians and infrastructure. Attempt capture where possible.
