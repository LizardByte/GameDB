After all, you've worked hard all week why not shave a few minutes off the trip to get more time on the water.\n\nAs the thought passes - you spot a state trooper's car on the opposite side of the highway pulse their roof-mounted lights on and off as you pass each other, and hit the brakes a few times to get under the speed limit. Your stomach sinks a little as you wonder if they were quick enough to get your plates.\n\nThe turn-off for the state forest approaches. You slow and pull your car into the side-road leading to the river-side park and recreation area. The park is mostly empty, bar a gentle spring breeze filling the air. Fantastic, after-all you don't feel much like small-talk, enough of that happens at the office.", "summary": "An 80KB interactive-fiction text adventure game that begins as you set out with your newly acquired kayak one weekend.
