The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...", "summary": "The first episode of BS Shin Onigashima.\n\nBS Shin Onigashima is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 distinct runs between September 29, 1996 and January 31, 1996. The game was popular and won its December 1997 rebroadcast through the votes of players in the Third Player's Choice competition. The game came in second (in terms of votes) to BS SimCity: Machi Tsukuri Taikai and so it was broadcast second as a 4-day broadcast.\n\nBS Shin Onigashima was a remake sequel to the earlier Shin Onigashima, a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in September of 1987. The major difference between the two games relate to the SoundLink elements that were introduced for the Satellaview broadcasts. BS Shin Onigashima was later re-made in December 1997 as the commercial release, Heisei Shin Onigashima, for the Nintendo Power system. This was later followed-up by the May 1998 Super Famicom cartridge release of the same name.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-shin-onigashima-dai-1-wa", "videos": [{"id": 58680, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0ubsIHwvYAs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ubsIHwvYAs", "title": "BS\u65b0\u30fb\u9b3c\u30f6\u5cf6\u30001\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ubsIHwvYAs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
