Movement 1 released because I wanted to focus on Uacultra 2 with 40oz. So about the maps, this wad contains 18 gothic, industrial, or hell-themed maps, many are actually a bit of a combination of themes. Expect numbers of monsters around the largest slaughter maps you've encountered, or possibly more. But the gameplay in most will be a little easier cause I overstock powerups."}
