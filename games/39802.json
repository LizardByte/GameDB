Internet sources also claim that this update was originally called Violence Fight II in Japan, but there is no solid proof to that claim. The only available versions are named Solitary Fighter. It's generally the same game, although the two bosses from the original are playable here. When fighting in the wider arenas, mostly female mooks keep appearing one at a time to support the main opponent, which are taken out with a few hits, but nonetheless very annoying. The bonus rounds add a bear to the tiger, but both fights now take places in cages with bars so thick that it's sometimes hard to see what's going on.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/solitary-fighter"}
