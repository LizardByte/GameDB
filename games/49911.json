Kids can learn their ABCs and begin to spell elementary words with this educational title featuring beloved characters from the award-winning Blue's Clues television series. There are six simple games to teach valuable lessons about the alphabet \u2014 none too stressful for little minds.\n\nThere's a xylophone game that challenges kids to duplicate musical sequences using letters, a leaf game that asks little ones to match lettered leaves with their appropriate baskets, while a soup game riffs off of the well-documented desire to play with food. There's lots of fun music to keep toes tapping, and the voice acting sounds just like the characters from the show.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blues-clues-blues-alphabet-book"}
