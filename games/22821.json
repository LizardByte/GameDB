Furthermore, battalions can be developed with specific strengths to support a personalized fighting strategy. The game also includes 25 different weapons, including Flame-throwers, Vortex Singularities, Plasma Rifles, Mini-guns, Ion Cannons and Nukes.\n\nSabotage and espionage missions allow units to deposit mines inside enemy buildings, steal research, and pass back vital information.", "summary": "Machines: Wired for War is a 3D real-time strategy game released for Microsoft Windows.
