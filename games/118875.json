While most people would never risk a solitary journey through the wilder parts of the land, you willingly accept the struggle.

Explore this world and gather as much information as possible to reveal the secrets surrounding the area. It\u2019s a dangerous task, but an equally respectable one.\n\nRoadwarden is an illustrated text-based RPG that uses isometric pixel art and combines mechanics borrowed from RPGs, Visual Novels, adventure games, and interactive fiction, such as inventory puzzles, dialogue choices, character abilities and progression, hit points, simple survival mechanics or quests restricted by in-game time.", "summary": "Roadwarden is an illustrated text-based RPG that uses isometric pixel art and combines mechanics borrowed from RPGs, Visual Novels, adventure games and interactive fiction.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/roadwarden", "videos": [{"id": 83557, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ewlZLcjPOjw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewlZLcjPOjw", "title": "Roadwarden | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ewlZLcjPOjw/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 83558, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BEq70qXWGBU"}]}
