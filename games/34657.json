A talking dog appears before her and she becomes startled by his revelation: They are gods and it is their duty to change the fate of any humans that ask for their help. Letters appear in the mail, so with pen in hand she begins her job.\n\nWILL: A Wonderful World features a fantastical tale and cast. A quiet nerd stuck in a hopeless, one-sided crush. An impoverished artist who\u2019s lost all hope and contemplates suicide. A rookie police officer who burns with justice and hopes for his first big case. A young woman desperately chasing her dream against all odds. Even a stray cat who would be satisfied with some dried fish to eat!\n\nDive deep into the story and learn about those that seek out your help, but remember: Changing someone\u2019s fate will affect others. Experience each story, edit letters, and solve puzzles; perhaps the young girl\u2019s memory will return, but what will she learn about herself and her mission? You must guide their fates, uncover the links between the storylines, and find the best path for all of those in need. WILL: A Wonderful World blends its imaginative story with fantastic presentation, featuring colorful artwork and a delightful soundtrack.", "summary": "Become a god and help change the fate of people, even the world!
