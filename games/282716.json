Dune was originally started by veteran programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark before they began working on the 5200 game \"The Last Starfighter\" (which also went unreleased). Unfortunately Gary and Bruce had only gone through the brainstorming process when work was stopped. However it appears that another programmer may have been assigned to pick up and continue work on Dune. Unfortunately only preliminary coding had been started before Jack Tramiel shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dune--3"}
