In a few months, I'll release the Alpha version. Even when the game is complete, it will be free for download. This is because the game is my creative project, and not a money-making production.\n\n System Requirements: This is an unusual game. Believe it or not, it's platform is Powerpoint. Yep, it's a fully functional and immersive experience too! To play the game, you must have PowerPoint 2007 or newer, a device running Windows, and the capability of playing MP3, WAV, AVI, and MP4 files. These files are common on Windows devices. \n\nWe have a Google+ Community!
