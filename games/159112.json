Discipline and excellence are a must for every young cadet.\nSophisticated weapons and strong fortifications make their bases almost impregnable.\n\nThe Redaxh definitely do not look human. More like insects, ugly insects.\nThe technologies are massively different from the other factions.\nThe weapon systems are incredibly advanced and devastating, but the structures look fragile. Still, you'd better run from their arms.\n\nEverything about the Zan seems cobbled together.\nWeapon systems seem outdated, not made for open combat.\nOn the other hand, they are extremely adept at attacking from ambush and are difficult for the enemy to see.", "summary": "2089: Space Divided is a classic science fiction real-time strategy game in which you collect resources, build up your base, raise troops and destroy your opponents with tactical finesse.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2089-space-divided"}
