Cerritos is ready to party at a Zebulon Sisters concert! Tendi's even more excited, as this\u2019ll be her first Chu Chu Dance! But first, they need to get through routine training exercises on the holodeck, which Boimler has been entrusted to organize. Boimler? With power? When has that ever been good?\n\nImpatient to get to the dance, the crew try to end the simulation only to find the Cerritos' computer has been hijacked by rogue AI Badgey. He's locked them in the holodeck and deactivated all safety protocols \u2013 so now Boimler, Tendi, Rutherford and Mariner must work through Star Trek stories, both familiar and new, so they can return to the real world. But be careful \u2013 if they don\u2019t succeed, they'll die for real. And even worse: they'll miss the party!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-trek-lower-decks"}
