The player controls a mercenary who, on each level, must find a key and make his way to the exit. Each level is a random, chaotic assortment of squares; the mercenary can move around thanks to his incredible jumping abilities, and his gun which allows him to destroy walls. A gun has unlimited ammo, but it takes a while to reload when its clip runs out. Destroyed wall sections re-appear after a while.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/krebswelte"}
