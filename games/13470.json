Unfortunately, searching for the eggs comes at a price.\n\nUg must also leap across rivers, dodge erupting volcanoes, and use a number of rocks to kill any land-based predators that get in his way. If he comes into contact with any of these, he will lose some energy, which can be restored by collecting fruit. Once Ug has taken all three eggs to his cave, he has to collect some wheels so that he can travel to the next island.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cavemania"}
