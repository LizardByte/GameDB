Nestled deep within is a small rocky pinnacle upon which rests the palace of The Guardian, the architect of the Vault of Knowledge.\n\nFor centuries people have visited the Guardian hoping for blessings and the chance to take the Trial of Knowledge but few have been granted the wish. After many wars and natural disasters the location of The Guardian eventually slipped from people's memories and was lost forever from maps. Only legends remain telling of the trial and the strange machines that seem to crackle with the power of the skies.\n\nFor years you have dreamt of finding the Vault and gaining the treasure of the ancients but the mountain paths have just led you round in circles. One day, while searching the northwest mountain peaks, you discovered a hidden trail marked with small piles of stones covered in unusual symbols. Something looks familiar and you suspect you have seen these symbols before in ancient books, but your memory is fading and you are not sure anymore.\n\nAfter days of walking past countless marker stones, the trail eventually descended from the higher peaks towards a misty valley. Far off in the distance you could see a small hill with what seemed to be a man made structure on the top but you will need to get closer to find out.\n\nThe trail leads down into a dense forest shrouded in a thick miasma that chills you to the bone. The boughs creak and groan but there is no wind, just the fog blocking out the light above. Several days pass and eventually the winding trail leads upwards again, out of the mist. You stand before a small ornate building with glass on all sides.\n\nYou enter the main door...", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-edge-of-forever", "videos": [{"id": 103735, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jDhXIaopo1s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDhXIaopo1s", "title": "Quake 3 - Map on the Edge of Forever (720p HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDhXIaopo1s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
