As it was it could be incredibly difficult, especially in the cavern levels. Several seconds of straight, unimpeded flight would suddenly be met by a narrow mountain. In addition, each shot would take 10 points from your score, so it was worthwhile to save your shots for when they counted rather than hold down the fire button.
