Hope is a puzzle and platform game which presents new ways of dealing with the problems that often make us give up halfway.\n\nA game developed with the aim of connecting people with their own emotions, teaching them to deal with everyday frustrations, benefiting from the mistakes made and using them as learning opportunities and motivation. Hope's goal is to instill more confidence in its users and help them to become better people, with possibly a better vision of the future; since the game acts not only on the emotional part, but also on the individual's cognitive abilities, both in relation to strategy and the speed of reaction to the spatial vision.", "summary": "Mistakes are not an impediment, but an opportunity to grow.
