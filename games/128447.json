The player is in control of a wizard who has to be guided around a garden while eating cherries and avoiding evil gremlins. The gremlins can be killed by either throwing a crystal ball or by making apples fall onto them. If the gremlins get frustrated or trapped they might eat the apples or dig their own passages to reach the wizard. Bonus points can be earned by eating a magic mushroom but it will at the same time enrage the gremlins and make them permanently furious. The main differences from the arcade game is that there are no alpha monsters or other enemies than the gremlins and that it is not possible to freeze their movements.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-wiz"}
