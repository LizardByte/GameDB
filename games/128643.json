Heavily influenced by the classics of the past, Red Horizon takes a modern spin on the genre combining it with some subtle Rogue-like elements to provide players with a unique experience every time they play.\n\nHop on board the Red Horizon and shoot your way through numerous waves of different enemies, eventually facing the final boss. Build up strength along your journey by finding items which will not only give you a power up but change the way you play. Just remember to choose wisely!\nNote from the Developer\nI made the Red Horizon whilst travelling to/from work on the train for a number of months. As of right now, the game is small in length but feature complete. With your support, I would love to evolve the game by adding:\n\nMore items\nMore bosses\nMore enemies\nMore ships\n\nI would also really appreciate any feedback you have in the Steam reviews, or by sending an email to the support contact.\n\nThanks for reading!\nGeorge", "summary": "Red Horizon is an addictive space shmup game.
