Similar to the 1988 Bikkuriman Daijikai, the game is an (improved) encyclopedia of the Akuma vs. Tenshi Seal series, containing seals from all 31 series. In the beginning the seals are all black and white, but players can obtain points and use them to buy Bikkuriman Choco, where the seals can be obtained and later viewed in color. Depending of the seal, once obtained they will also have extra content unlocked, like extra information, their alternate versions from other products (like Bikkuriman Ice), and the ability to move foil cards (like Black Zeus) to see their colors. Points are earned in three ways: Once per day a certain amount is given to the player, by answering questions in the quiz mode, or trading duplicated and unwanted (becoming black and white again and locking bonus content if all are given) seals for 5-150 (depending of the seal) points each. It is also possible to trade seals with other players.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bikkuriman-daijiten"}
