It\u2019s useless to rely on justice cause everything here is being resolved by brutal force of explosives. You have a whole lot of enemies, they are aggressive and tireless but who says that there\u2019s safety in numbers?\n\nYou are right in the center of violent sheep fighting so just grab the nearest bomb and throw it in your enemies while they grow in number with each new level. Sure you can choose the best level of complexity for yourself but don\u2019t count on it to save you cause this game is for life-and-death.\n\nDon\u2019t let the colorful graphics and nice background music fool you, this is serious, you have just one life and many enemies with a single goal to destroy you. To make this unequal fight easier on you, use bonuses like first aid box, vest and accelerator, and your victory on each level will increase your score so that you can show it off to your friends in OpenFeint.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlesheep"}
