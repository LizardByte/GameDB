The game is all about fast aiming and features six missions, although only three are available at the beginning. Each mission is divided into three stages with a level boss at the end. The player (policeman) uses a special helmet equipped with a viewfinder computer. The computer marks the opponent in a frame defining the threat level and time remaining to attack. The player is equipped with a gun and bazooka. During the mission, he can raise the weapon of the killed opponent, f.e. shotgun, grenade, M-16, automated pistol. Killing a hostage takes one life. Life can be supplemented by finding a heart symbol.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ad-cop"}
