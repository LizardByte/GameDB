After the great success it was, this version for mobile phones arrived in some Sony Ericsson devices.\n\nErix tests our skill and dexterity, despite the simplicity of its mechanics. The only thing you have to do is cut out rectangular areas on the board until you cut out more or less 75% of the total to go to the next level.\n\nYou can make horizontal or vertical movements, while avoiding the obstacles in the game. When you have cut out a rectangle, you capture a portion of the board, we get inside and go for the next cut. Speed is the key. A piece of advice, don't come across anything that moves around the board, it could be your end.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/erix", "videos": [{"id": 100706, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TJ9EC5rLUjA"}, {"id": 100707, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "F68EOBzfU8Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F68EOBzfU8Y", "title": "Erix Gameplay on Sony Ericsson k660 176x220 java game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F68EOBzfU8Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 100709, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tGUWynIN9-8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGUWynIN9-8", "title": "Sony Ericsson W595 gaming", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tGUWynIN9-8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
