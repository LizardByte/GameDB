The level is set in a sort of abandoned megastructure, similar to a large shopping mall made out of concrete and marble. Spiderwebs and noticeable signs can be found all around. The map design is complex and intricate, with several interconnected areas and pathways that the player can choose, which encourages exploration due to the non-linearity of the map, and all the hidden and secret spots that can be found. It is a very early example of a semi-realistic map trying to recreate an urban-like structure.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skycity"}
