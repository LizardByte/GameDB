With the F-Zero Grand Prix over, racers now take part in the high-thrill, zero-gravity G-Zero Grand Prix races.\n\nThe racers effectively fly around the 3D wireframe circuits. Three of the original racers were confirmed to return (Falcon, Stingray and Goose), and joined by a new craft, Origammy.\n\nA prototype of the game was shown at E3 1996, and it was previewed by Nintendo Power magazine. However, by 1996 the Virtual Boy was already considered a failure and was discontinued shortly after.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zero-racers"}
