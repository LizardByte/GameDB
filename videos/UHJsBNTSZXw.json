The ground underneath the land is filled with ruins, treasures, and monsters, just waiting to be found. Luckily, he's armed with his trusty drill ready to explore the earth.\n\nThe core of Dunk's journey is digging. While underground, players can hold down the R trigger to rev up their drill and start drilling through dirt or stone. There are no preset maps and no pre-made tunnels: players make their own paths, digging in whatever direction they please. Their tunnels are persistent and will always stay in exactly the same position between play sessions, allowing players to slowly build an extensive tunnel network over time. Dunk will slowly get more tired over time as he digs, but luckily he can carry a supply of his favourite booze, \"beev\", with him; taking a swig of beev helps him recover his strength, and he can always refresh his supply of beev back at town.\n\nHidden throughout the world are tombs, filled with treasures - but also monsters. If Dunk runs into these, he can explore them to collect whatever treasures he finds while defending himself from monsters with his hammer. After collecting treasures, he can bring them back to the nearest settlement to decode ancient relics and sell valuable items, using the proceeds to find more supplies to keep him going.\n\nNotes:\nSorry about the quality, but this is probably the only video of this trailer that exists on the internet.\n\nDo your f*cking job weebs and translate it already.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UHJsBNTSZXw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UHJsBNTSZXw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UHJsBNTSZXw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "DriHoo (Xbox) - Trailer", "description": "Japanese exclusive Xbox game\n\nDeveloped and published by: Highwaystar\nReleased: Nov 28, 2002\nPlatform: Xbox\n\nDescription:\nDunk the dwarf is a solo treasure hunter, left to his own devices after a cave-in separates him from the rest of his crew.
