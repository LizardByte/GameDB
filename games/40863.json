This game was only released in North America and Europe. Being the final game ever released by Atari for the Atari Lynx, this game would ultimately begin an era where Atari would produce games for other console systems as opposed to their own.\n\nSuper Asteroids pits the player against a never ending supply of extraterrestrial debris and enemy UFOs trained to kill any human spacecraft. He must destroy everything while snatching power-ups. Super Missile Command has the player defend various of his space colonies from incoming missiles, satellites, and enemy fighters. Intermissions allow players to buy better missiles and defense system to bolster up his defense of his space colonies.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 51718, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ITQtOF7Wr_s"}]}
