The game centers around a reclusive artist named Alex, who appears to live alone. His computer has broken down, so he has been reduced to reading books he has grown tired of and sleeping to explore his dream world.\n\nInspiration also makes use of character dialogue, which helps gain an insight into the mind of Alex and figures he sees in his dreams. Interacting with certain objects in the real world bedroom sometimes make Alex speak his thoughts on them."}
