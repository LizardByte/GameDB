Acquire enough of the same essence to summon that monster.\n\nYour monsters will fight against the heroes, stalling their advance and keeping them from reaching your inner sanctum.\n\nEvery monster type and hero has unique stats: Health, Attack, Physical Defense, and Special Defense, and each monster and hero will attach with either Physical or Special. Based on these stats, your monsters will fare better against some heroes than others.\n\nYour realm contains 7 locations, each with it's own, unique monsters. When a hero is left unopposed by your forces, it will gradually, but steadily advance through the current location.\n\nWhen the hero reaches the end of a location and moves on to the next one, your leftover essence will be used to construct a temporary, magical barrier, which will block the heroes from advancing for a short time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-match", "videos": [{"id": 36414, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uz7ZCPSPsVg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz7ZCPSPsVg", "title": "Monster Match Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uz7ZCPSPsVg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
