Play the demo and wishlist here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559720/\n\nFrom the creator of The First Tree comes We Harvest Shadows, an emotional first-person narrative game with farming and horror elements. Players take control of Garrett, a transplant from the city who has exiled himself to an abandoned farm for the rest of his life. He thinks the world is better without him in it.\n\nEach new day brings a new to-do list. Players will fix up their house, care for livestock, and improve their farmstead, all while exploring the hundreds of acres surrounding the farm. But in the quiet of the lonely nights, something stirs. Is Garrett truly alone? Or is something stalking him from the shadows?\n\nTaking inspiration both from slow-burn P.T.-style psychological horror games and Edith Finch-style personal first-person titles, this game plays on poignant horror themes to gradually imagine a terrifying vision that Garrett must save himself from\u2014until the soul-shaking end.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5svvtbIdKFU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5svvtbIdKFU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5svvtbIdKFU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5svvtbIdKFU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5svvtbIdKFU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "We Harvest Shadows - Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "A first-person farming horror allegory.
