Like my Rutile Ruby & Star Sapphire hacks and my Nova Sun & Umbra Moon hacks, their main purpose is to provide a more challenging game experience while not artificially limiting the player. The premier feature of Supernova Sun and Penumbra Moon is the ground-up redesign of Pok\u00e9mon Trainers in the world to increase the game\u2019s challenge. Every trainer in the game has been edited, and the level curve expects use of the Experience Share, which means that the player levels up very quickly. Every Pok\u00e9mon in Trainers\u2019 teams has a a proper moveset and many are holding items. The Elite Four and Champion are Level 100, and the player doesn\u2019t need to grind to equal that!\n\nSupernova Sun and Penumbra Moon\u2019s secondary focus is inspired by Super Smash Bros. Melee\u2019s \u201c20XX Hack Pack\u201d which is designed to improve competitive players\u2019 ability to practice and grind. In Supernova Sun and Penumbra Moon\u2019s Legit Build, everything obtainable is 100% legal and legitimate for real online battles or trades. In all Builds, some features are designed to make preparing competitive teams much less of a hassle. Competitive hold items are much more available, a 6IV Ditto is available through an in-game trade (holding a Destiny Knot), Eggs hatch in one cycle, and Level 100 Memento Blissey battles are available in the Battle Buffet once the main story has been beaten.\u200b", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-penumbra-moon", "videos": [{"id": 107935, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VAV5VScu34c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAV5VScu34c", "title": "3DS Mod: Supernova Sun & Penumbra Moon!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAV5VScu34c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
