The game is played on a grid in which all squares are filled with kinds of cheese. The player controls a mouse which is initially in the centre of the grid. The object of the game is to eat all the cheeses without being caught by the cats which patrol the game area. As the player progresses through the levels there are more patrolling cats and they move faster and in less predictable paths.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cheesy-pursuit"}
