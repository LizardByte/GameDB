Once the objective is selected, the player needs to select the squad members based upon their skills. Each potential squad member will have a primary skill and a secondary skill which is only revealed by interviewing the potential recruit. \n \nCertain skills are essential in order to complete your objective, for example a photographer and explosives expert for the example above and some are more generally useful, such as a diver which will let you explore any lakes that are encountered. \n \nOnce the game begins you need to explore the forest in order to locate the compound or other elements that may help you complete the objective.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/special-operations", "videos": [{"id": 34467, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mg5oFzAIzBA"}]}
