It's a huge open world, full of hidden secrets, treasures, and creatures. You'll run around the woods, fight monsters, and talk to ostensibly shady characters! All from your pocket! Be warned though - you never know what the forest might be hiding, and not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.\n\nAfterplace has been designed from the ground up to be a fast, fluid, beautiful experience for mobile. There are no virtual buttons. You can move and attack by touching anywhere. You can tap objects directly to interact or attack, or use two thumbs like a traditional controller. The game will adapt dynamically to your play style. Pick up and set down the game at your own pace, it will always save your progress. Afterplace is made to feel like a full-fledged indie adventure game that fits in your pocket.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/afterplace", "videos": [{"id": 120234, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_WRuH25odAs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WRuH25odAs", "title": "Afterplace: Steam Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_WRuH25odAs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
