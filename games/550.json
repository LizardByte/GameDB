Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him. Athena stops Ares and tells him they only came for the Marked Warrior, not to take the boy's life. Taken to the Domain of Death, Deimos is imprisoned and tortured by the God of Death, Thanatos.", "summary": "Set in the realm of Greek mythology, God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a single-player game that allows players to take on the powerful role of Spartan warrior Kratos.

In his quest to rid himself of the nightmares that haunt him, Kratos must embark on a journey that will reveal the origins of lost worlds, and finally answer long-awaited questions about his dark past. Armed with the deadly chained Blades of Chaos, he will have to overcome armies of mythological monsters, legions of undead soldiers, and amazingly dangerous and brutal landscapes throughout his merciless quest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ghost-of-sparta", "videos": [{"id": 39216, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bDN3aUzyctY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDN3aUzyctY", "title": "God of War: Ghost of Sparta Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDN3aUzyctY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39217, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XCkvp2btq9o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCkvp2btq9o", "title": "God of War: Ghost of Sparta - Longplay | PSP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XCkvp2btq9o/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 2320, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 3884, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zw.jpg"}, "name": "Athena", "species": 5}, {"id": 2054, "name": "Ship Captain"}, {"id": 3544, "name": "Deimos"}, {"id": 2134, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3877, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zp.jpg"}, "name": "Kratos", "species": 5}, {"id": 9810, "name": "Ares Supporter"}, {"id": 9814, "name": "Last Spartan"}, {"id": 9826, "name": "Spartan Harlot 1"}, {"id": 9809, "name": "Citizen Male 7"}, {"id": 9539, "name": "Grave Digger"}, {"id": 9833, "name": "Daugher of Death"}, {"id": 9825, "name": "Soldier 7"}, {"id": 9807, "name": "Young Kratos"}, {"id": 9823, "name": "Citizen Female 1"}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Citizen 4"}, {"id": 9813, "name": "Crazed Soldier"}, {"id": 9818, "name": "Young Mother"}, {"id": 9820, "name": "Citizen 3"}, {"id": 9824, "name": "Citizen Female 2"}, {"id": 9827, "name": "Citizen Female 8"}, {"id": 9835, "name": "Young Deimos"}, {"id": 9832, "name": "Lanaeus"}, {"id": 9830, "name": "Thera"}, {"id": 9828, "name": "Spartan Harlot 2"}, {"id": 9834, "name": "Spartan Harlot 3"}, {"id": 2141, "name": "Poseidon"}, {"id": 9808, "name": "Solider 8"}, {"id": 9829, "name": "Citizen Female 9"}, {"id": 9831, "name": "Midas"}, {"id": 9817, "name": "Daughter of Death"}, {"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}, {"id": 556, "name": "Mother"}, {"id": 9805, "name": "Citizen"}, {"id": 2140, "name": "Soldier"}, {"id": 9806, "name": "Thanatos"}, {"id": 2133, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3885, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zx.jpg"}, "name": "Zeus", "species": 5}, {"id": 56, "name": "Narrator"}]}
