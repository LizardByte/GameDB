In this game, we highlight the frustration of having decisions made for you and not knowing how to talk to your parents about it. 2 American serves as a window into some of the hardships a child of immigrants born in America might have to deal with in their immigrant household such as not understanding what your parents are saying when they speak to you, being compared to your more successful cousin, and arguing about what career you must have in the future.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2-american"}
