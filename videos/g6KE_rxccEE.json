Thank you so much!\n\nRelic Hunters Legend is an online cooperative Shooter/Looter/RPG from the creators of Chroma Squad, Dungeonland and Relic Hunters Zero.\n\nThe game is currently under development. If you want to play it early and support us, please join in our Founders program.\n\nhttp://www.relichunters.com.br/\n\n*Read our Comic Series!*\nTapas: http://bit.ly/2y4sPkh\nWebToons: http://bit.ly/2xEZQHN\n\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/RelicHuntersU\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/RelicHuntersUniverse\nTwitch: http://www.twitch.tv/playrelichunters\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7fjaqtV \nForums: http://www.relichunters.com.br/forums\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ) Is it online co-op?\nYup. We have full online cooperative gameplay for up to 4 players. You can play alone too, if you want.\n\nQ) Will this game be free, just like Zero?\nA: Yes, the game will be free-to-play. However, unlike Zero, we are trying to make a living off of it, so it will have microtransactions to support development.\n\nQ) Will these microtransactions ruin the game?\nA: Not at all. We want to support the game and make it last for a long time, we are not looking to \"make a quick buck\". Microtransactions will be fair, honest and transparent and won't get in the way of gameplay.\n\nQ) What do Founders get?\nA: Early access to the game, a lot of cool rewards, and participate in development! When the game goes Free to everyone, you will also get a lot of premium in-game currency. Check our page for details on all the cool rewards!\n\nQ) Will it run on my computer?\nA: Probably. We are designing the game to be very lightweight. Pretty much any gaming computer can run the game, even with pretty old graphics cards.\n\nI will update this FAQ as more questions come up!\n\nCheers,\n~Mark", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6KE_rxccEE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6KE_rxccEE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6KE_rxccEE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6KE_rxccEE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6KE_rxccEE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Relic Hunters Legend - Kickstarter Gameplay Trailer (60fps)", "description": "Want to be a Founder and play Early? https://www.relichunters.com.br/\n\nWE GOT FUNDED ON KICKSTARTER!
