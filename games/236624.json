Will you rise to the top as a diplomatic and cunning ambassador? Or will you smash the forces of your opponents with brute strength and steal resources only to strengthen your own democracy? The choice is yours.\n\nAncient Society is developed as an NFT-based Play-to-Earn game that incorporates all the thrills and values of NFTs and cryptocurrency coupled with the excitement of real-world building, resource-gathering, and role-playing. Ancient Society is a browser-based game with cross-compatibility with mobile devices and our metaverse-based NFT Worlds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ancient-society"}
