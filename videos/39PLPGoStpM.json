(it'll be fun i swear) https://www.twitch.tv/mysticslime\n\u27a4 Hangout in my totally not dead and super alive Discord! https://discord.gg/WyRKahySVd\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA couple of quick things:\n\n- After getting Noelle I apologize if there are some pauses; had to make sure I did the route correctly and at the time of recording it was my first playthrough.\n\n- If you notice that my saves change after I get Noelle, it\u2019s because they do. There\u2019s actually a splice in the footage around that point, with the first part of chapter 2 actually being from my neutral run of the game, and from that point on its the genocide route. This is because the neutral route is the exact same as the genocide route until a key moment, so while they may technically be different runs the \u2018full run\u2019 seen here is identical to an actual full genocide run.\n\n- Just for those wondering, the start of chapter 2 is not very influenced by the 'genocide' route of chapter 1. The only difference is that some minor npc's aren't there, but besides that everything is the same.\n\n- If you want to do the genocide chapter 2 route for yourself, here\u2019s the instructions on how! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AL95g4hxFb5WWHX1kkt6LI-Wbkwt1x3V8lodhPFBkMU/preview?pru=AAABfCAenew*kqbawetqp3rS00ELqdGWpw\n\n- Technically in the video, the chapter 2 genocide run doesn't use the chapter 1 save file. I did a genocide chapter 2 run WITH a genocide chapter 1 save file, and nothing really changes.\n\n- Also sorry for the lacking timestamps right now, will hopefully get them done later\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 - Chapter 1\n2:12:40 - Chapter 2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39PLPGoStpM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39PLPGoStpM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39PLPGoStpM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39PLPGoStpM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39PLPGoStpM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deltarune Chapter 1 + 2 COMPLETE GENOCIDE (Snowgrave Chapter 2) | No Commentary", "description": "\u27a4 Come check me out on Twitch!
