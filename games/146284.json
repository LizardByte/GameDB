This new video redemption piece brings back the classic PAC-MAN game concept but now rewards players with tickets or a gift card. Players acquire points by munching on as many of the familiar Pac-dots and fruits as they can while being chased by the ghosts; Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. If successful in entering the ghost house, players can win the \u201cPAC-POT\u201d and are treated with a mesmerizing PAC-MAN animation. Options for the \u201cPAC-POT\u201d can include tickets or gift cards*. The cabinet is beautifully lit from top to bottom with multicoloured LEDs as well as a spectacular LED marquee that scrolls the classic 8-bit PAC-MAN animation."}
