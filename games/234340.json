But how?\"\n\nKaoru is enthusiastic about this \"tour of memories\" that she will go on with Shiori.\nShe too wants to forget about her teacher, who was her first crush.\n\nTheir relationship is then discovered by Inohara Riku, a fellow classmate who also harbors feelings for Shiori.\nAnd so the curtain rises on this sometimes slapstick fun as well as poignant love story.", "summary": "This is a story about finding love to overwrite the feelings for the one they held dearest.
