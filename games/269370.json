The game may look like another graphic/paint tool software, but it is more of a freestyle drawing software with games. It does not feature zooming capabilities, or let players draw pixel-by-pixels. It only uses 12 colors, and lets players select different types of canvas. Aside from normal pens, there are pens that draw pictures for players. For example, a circle drawn with a black pen may become a black tire, or a circle drawn with a blue pen may become a puddle of water, and a circle drawn with a yellow pen may become a full moon. Other canvases are more like mini-games, where the player will need to draw a frying pan to catch eggs thrown by a game character, or draw objects on top of a jumping board and plunge them into the sea. Players can save pictures they've drawn and record a three-minute movie clip showing their drawing's progression. Up to about ten clips can be recorded.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bikkuri-mouse"}
