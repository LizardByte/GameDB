No programming knowledge is needed.\n\nWe always wanted to have a comprehensive tool to channel our ideas in a fast and fun way without having to resort to several softwares, from there the idea of \u200b\u200bgolden8bits was born. A development environment for everything. We do not aim to compete with big development engines, but give the possibility to quickly create a sketch, mockup of a pixelart 8bits style game.\n\nCreate a video game entirely without touching a line of code!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/golden8bits"}
