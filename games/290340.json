This game is not suited for children or those who are easily disturbed.\n\nThe objective of this game is to move around a desolated town and touch certain magic pillars. When you touch the pillars (it's a little finicky, so try to move around them a bit), a streetlight will come on near a lighthouse to signify your progress. You must light all six streetlights, at which point the lighthouse will light up. Touch the light of the lighthouse to complete the game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cathode-ray-sunshine"}
