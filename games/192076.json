Rather than kick the buddy, here you flip the buddy! You may flip it one or two times in a row, but you have to make sure it will always land on some piece of furniture. If your buddy fall on floor, game over! Simple but very addictive, this game will let you choose your buddy character and will bring your hours of casual fun!"}
