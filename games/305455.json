And, it features four unique phases of action in one full cycle of play. In \"phase one\", you must destroy a squadron of fighters that attack in two different patterns-a zigzag and a backward -forward motion. In \"phase two\", another squadron attacks, this time in a circular formation.\n\nIn \"phase three\", the enemy command ships are vulnerable but watch out for their barrage of missiles ! Knock out all three command ships and the scoreboard gives you a \"GOOD\" rating.\n\nNow you are challenged to complete a difficult docking maneuver. Your earth ship launches a space shuttle and the countdown begins. The faster you succeed in docking, the more points you will score. And, if all 5 of your earth ships have not been eliminated, you may continue to play.\n\nIf you are very skillful, you can score up to 10,000 points. And, to add to the challenge and fun, there are four skill levels from which to choose. Before playing, read on for complete directions.\" - Epoch Manual", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galaxy-ii"}
