Four hundred years ago, Ninla, queen of Aravonuria, was condemned to a terrible curse. Under the curse, the once beautiful queen was transformed into a disfigured and evil snake-bodied naga creature. Henceforth she would live her life as an evil creature. From the impact of the curse, the mutant army under Naga's command brought bitter destruction and a terrible curse to the dynasty. This great curse spread from Queen Naga's palace and within a year it had taken over the entire continent within Arasina. The four great dynasties united to fight for the future of their empire, and the sorcerer Rahun trapped the curse deep within Aravonuria with the help of ancient and dark ancient magic! In return for their service, the goddess of Aravonuria granted the four great dynasties, Rahun, Rasan, Teven and Solon, independence and freedom from each other. Each dynasty became the sacred army of Aravonuria, representing the four symbols. The Rahun dynasty was considered the greatest of all empires, and represents the sacred power of Aravonuria. The Rasan dynasty possessed the power of ancient and dark magic to command the magical and intuitive powers of Aravonuria, as it is now endowed with the sacred powers of ancient magic. The Teven dynasty was defined as the representation of war and power, and all the power of war was given to them by the goddess. The Solon dynasty was recognized as the commercial dynasty of the empire. Almost all the merchants are found in Solon. These four dynasties were rewarded with abundance and a carefree life. After all, the world of darkness could no longer resist the Aravonurian. But was it really so? One of Naga's generals, Minotaur, had once fallen in love with Queen Naga, but the cursed queen would never return. Unable to find a cure, the General Minotaur, in his unending hatred and the pain of his love, gave his soul to Nasfary, the god of hell, and dedicated himself to serving him! Nasfary accepted this reward. The Minotaur was transformed into a disfigured and horrible half-human, half-pig-headed creature and imprisoned himself in a cursed cave! The Minotaur, who had done all this for his love of Naga, begged Nasfary to avenge him. Nasfary, the god of hell, granted the Minotaur's request in return. Summoned from the bottomless depths of the evil and dark world, with the help of ancient and dark magics, they opened a black fire portal to the Aravonurian world! The portal allowed all demons to pass from the nether world to Arasina. The infernal demons destroyed everything in their path. The bloodthirsty earth was saturated. The burning buildings lit up the night like a bonfire. Aravonurian's army fought with all its might but lost the battle. The survivors boarded ships and left this continent. Now we are heading for our homeland! It will shelter us and our civilization will shine again. But the feeling of revenge lives in us and will never let us forget... Every creature of hell will see that we are not lost in silence! Next time we will fight the devil more prepared...", "summary": "Magic to Master is a player-friendly, open-world far east MMORPG with unique combat system and a game world that sets no limits to the game experience.
