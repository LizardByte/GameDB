This vessel is humanity's last and only hope.", "summary": "Xatax is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player must defend the remains of the Alliance's guilds against the titular aliens. This is accomplished in a traditional shoot-em-up fashion, fighting waves of alien ships and stationary turrets. The player-controlled ship can become stronger by collecting power capsules dropped by defeated enemies.\n\nThe game features three different worlds, of which the shareware version only contains the first.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xatax", "videos": [{"id": 95731, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0YAIzYLrCHI"}]}
