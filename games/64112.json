Otokojuku is a 2D fighting game based on the manga series. Fighters are cel-shaded and colored with bright colors for a distinctive look. The fighting is presented on a 2D plane and hearkens back to old school fighting games where the camera pulls in when the combatants are close and out when they're far apart. Backgrounds are well done including one where a troupe of yankii gangsters are apparently punching the air and another where seated monks sit forlornly in the background.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sakigake-otokojuku"}
