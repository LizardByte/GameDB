Kamishiro Gakuen Maboroshi Kouroku Kuru NuGiA, often just shortened to \"Nugya\", is about a story that unfolds in both modern times and the Taisho era, surrounding the \"Kamiyori\" that occurs once every 100 years in the town of Jindai. The main characters, one in the modern era and one in the Taisho era, both help to fight against demons.\n\nBattles are turn-based, including a system in which you can use interchangeable skills. There is a \"feeling system\" that responds with \"joy, anger, sadness, or pleasure\" depending on the situation, but it has almost no relationship with the progress of the main game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kamishiro-gakuen-maboroshi-kouroku-kuru-nugia"}
