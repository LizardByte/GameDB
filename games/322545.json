Of course, the majority of them need to be unlocked by winning competitions and saving up money from different races.\n\nYour objective during each race is to come in first, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the fastest. To help things go your way, you can use up to eight different power-ups that allow you to activate shields, drop mines, launch lightning bolts, and much more.\n\nBlur Overdrive is a fun three-dimensional racing game that, in addition to boasting excellent graphics, has truly great gameplay. Its control system, which is often a problem in other Android racing games, is a true delight.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blur-overdrive", "videos": [{"id": 133384, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "QcIUR24mq3s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIUR24mq3s", "title": "Blur Overdrive - Android - HD Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcIUR24mq3s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133385, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "kU-ZK2f9ovg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU-ZK2f9ovg", "title": "Official Blur Overdrive (Android) Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kU-ZK2f9ovg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
