It's up to you to carry the ball past the enemy Touchdown line by any means necessary to win your team points. Blast opponents out of the sky, use rocket boosters to create sneak attacks, and even fully obliterate enemy power suits. Show no mercy.\nTeams score a point every time they make a touchdown. The team with the most points after a 15 minute match wins the game.
