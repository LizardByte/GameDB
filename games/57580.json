Normally the night shift is pretty uneventful, but tonight the hotel's elevators have taken on a life of their own! You need to get to the top of the hotel, but the elevators are simply not an option. To get to the top floor you will need to race along each floor of the building to the stairs while avoiding the out-of-control elevators!
