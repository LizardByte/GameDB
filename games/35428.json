Each player is given a set of Rock Paper Scissors cards and Star betting chips with which to play matches, trade, buy information and buy other players. As the cards dwindle down, two at a time, from being used in matches, who has what becomes critical information. Players each try to figure out who to face, who to avoid, who to work with or betray so they can hoard the most Stars."}
