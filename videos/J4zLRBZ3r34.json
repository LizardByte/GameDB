{"id": "J4zLRBZ3r34", "snippet": {"title": "Leiria -Stargazer- Hard Mode ALL Clear 2.3 Billion", "description": "Keep watching until the end trust me.\n\nLeiria -Stargazer- is a very fun doujin shmup that is heavily inspired by Cave's style of shooters. You unlock hard mode after 1cc'ing normal and there are quite a few changes as opposed to normal mode. These include that the maximum multiplier goes up to x500, different patterns, different TLB and suicide bullets everywhere. \n\nThe scoring system is basically Espgaluda. You collect gems from enemies (closer = more gems) and use these to cancel bullets in Kakusei mode or Accel mode as it's called here. The multiplier you reached resets every time you exit Accel mode.\nIf you're out of gems in Accel mode the bullets increase twice in speed and don't cancel anything. In Accel you do get an autobomb but it consumes half your entire bomb gauge if you do. The Kakusei overmode levels are also taken over in this game from Espgaluda (higher level = more gems), so I spent the majority of stage 1 getting it up to max.\n\nI've said before that the TLB is different and this is quite interesting. It normally behaves like every other boss in the game but on hard mode it behaves more like Hibachi from DDP. It's a nice touch. The TLB can only be seen if you 1cc up to that point of course. \n\nYou get the hidden extend by destroying the two side pods on the stage 5 midboss.\nNo idea if this is a good score or not.\n\nEverything after the name entry can only be seen after you 1cc Hard mode.\nIt's so ridiculously hidden I love it. Leiria has a VIVID imagination. \n\nThis game is actually freeware!
