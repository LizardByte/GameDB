It\u2019s about getting better acquainted with friendly strangers by seeing them repeatedly.\n\nThe environments are sourced from photographs and pieced together like a collage. The trails draw inspiration from hikes in the Northeastern US (specifically NJ, NY, CT, MA). We wanted the place to feel realistic, idyllic, and familiar like a nostalgic memory, all at the same time.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a short, relaxing, and cozy time, come visit our trails and be friends with our hikers!", "summary": "Tree Trunk Brook is a tiny adventure game about hiking during the pandemic.
