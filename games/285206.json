Bringing the original PS2 classic, MegaMan X8 back to it's 16-bit roots! Play as X and blast through a familiar yet fresh experience!\n\nMega Man X8 16-bit is a reimagining of the PS2 original with SNES styled graphics. The aim was to demake X8 in a similar feel to the first three Mega Man X games, while trying to actually finish a low-scope fangame. After two and a half years of development, version 1.0 was released in September 7th 2024, making the game fully playable from start to finish with X, but Zero and Axl are not featured in the game in any capacity.\n\nIn addition to the 16-bit graphics, the game differs from the original game by offering slightly different level designs at times, armor effects, and boss weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-x8-16-bit"}
