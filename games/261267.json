Most notably, prior to beginning the first chapter, a player is able to create their protagonist, choosing not just their gender and class, but also their background, altering the course of the game's story! Additionally, as this hack is filled with decisions for the player to make, the game features several route splits that greatly impact the trajectory of a player's experience, truly making your choices matter.\" - Paul DiSalvo", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-legends-of-avenir"}
