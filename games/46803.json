It is the first video game with a jumping character (predating Donkey Kong by 3 years), which by some definitions could make it the first platform game. The player controls a frog on lily pads and attempts to catch (with the frog's tongue and while jumping) various insects (butterflies and dragonflies) worth different amounts of points in a set amount of time.\n\nFrogs is one of the first arcade games to include a static background as part of the arcade cabinet.[citation needed] The game\u2019s graphics are \"projected\" by laying the monitor flat on its back and reflecting the computer-generated graphics of the frogs and flies toward the player via a mirror at a 45-degree angle. (The game\u2019s graphics were actually generated and shown backward, so the mirror reflection would show letters and numbers properly.)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frogs", "videos": [{"id": 46107, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_7jNCRUzGCA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7jNCRUzGCA", "title": "Frogs - (1978) - Arcade - gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_7jNCRUzGCA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
