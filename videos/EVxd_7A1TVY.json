It features character designs and an opening animation from Spumco, the folks behind Ren and Stimpy among other things. You're probably thinking that it would be some sort of 3D platformer but you'd be wrong.\r\n\r\nIt's actually a Voice Acting Sim! You step into the shoes of one of the zany cast and act your way through the game. There are 6 stages including a Western(Shown here) and Horror among others.\r\n\r\nGameplay is similar to that of Karaoke Revolution and other such games. Speak the lines into the mic and you are judged. Japanese not up to snuff? You could always play via the controller where you simply time your button presses ala many rhythm games. This playstyle is much more import friendly, though not as fun.\r\n\r\nSadly, my mic is broken so I was unable to capture any gameplay with the mic. What's show here is the controller method of play as well as the hilarious intro.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EVxd_7A1TVY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EVxd_7A1TVY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EVxd_7A1TVY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Yoake no Mariko (PS2 JPN) Intro and Gameplay", "description": "Yoake no Mariko for the Ps2 is an interesting game.
