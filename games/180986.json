Due to its effect on the mortal plane, the Gods were forced to punish themselves - to prevent such a thing from happening again. As such, they were all but cut off from the mortal world, with little to no influence, leading humanity to lose their faith.\nHowever, one group survived the thousands of years that passed after the war - the Sanguis vampire family. Their goal across those millennia was to undo the binding that their patron deity, Niscura was under. They wanted the Goddess of Dimensions and Shadow to be free again\u2026\n\u2026and they succeeded.", "summary": "Set in an original world with its own cast of characters, this hack is a 68 exit-long adventure, with many of the levels having their own unique theming, with all of the graphics being original and hand-drawn.
