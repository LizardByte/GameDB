The tale goes that a little boy named Charlie has died and his soul has remained trapped on Earth. Charlie's spirit can be summoned by crossing two pens or pencils to create a grid (with sectors labelled \"yes\" and \"no\") and then asking questions of \"Charlie\". The upper pencil is then expected to rotate to indicate the answer to such questions. But, the main question everyone asks is \"can we play Charlie Charlie.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/charlie-charlie-the-challenge-and-game"}
