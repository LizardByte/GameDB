There is a new script and newly recorded voice acting, as well as an option to use the original Japanese voices. Maria Renard has been added as a boss and playable character, sporting a new moveset modeled after her abilities in Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. Several familiars, which were omitted from previous international versions of the original game, have been re-added. Like the Xbox 360 version, \"I Am the Wind\" was replaced with \"Mournful Serenade\"--a new piece composed by Michiru Yamane--as the closing theme. An English-recorded version of the song \"Nocturne\" has also been added.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
