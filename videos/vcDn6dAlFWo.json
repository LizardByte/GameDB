{"id": "vcDn6dAlFWo", "snippet": {"title": "Snow Bros. Jr. (Game Boy) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1992 action game for the Nintendo Game Boy, Snow Bros. Jr.\n\nSnow Bros. was originally an arcade title by Toaplan released in 1990. It played a lot like Bubble Bobble - it has you battling through several single-screen stages by trapping enemies and (hopefully!) earning huge point bonuses with combo moves.\n\nExcept, you know, with snowballs. Not bubbles.\n\nThe concept is virtually identical, but the snowball rolling mechanics tweaked things just enough to keep things fresh and fun, however familiar the format might be otherwise. \n\nThis Game Boy port is one of two home versions released in the US for dedicated game machines, the other being the astronomically expensive NES game (though this version is hardly cheap, either!). There was also an excellent, Japanese-only Mega Drive port developed by Toaplan themselves. You can find my playthrough of the NES version here: https://youtu.be/fmt7wS9yQfo\n\nThe Game Boy version fared quite well, especially considering the limitations of the hardware. Some changes had to be made: it is now a single-player only experience, some of the bosses had to be changed, and some graphics have been simplified to accommodate the low-resolution and poor contrast of the Game Boy screen. It does offer some sense of compensation for these quirks, though. There is a whole new set of Game Boy-exclusive stages to play through, which is a really nice bonus for fans that have previously played other versions of the game.\n\nIf you liked Snow Brothers on the other platforms, you'll like this one too. The graphics are clean, the sound is catchy, and the game play feels almost exactly the same as the excellent NES port. Those extra stages and some new cinema screens are cool to see if you're already familiar with the original.\n\nOverall, it's a totally solid port that respects the Game Boy's limitations and delivers an experience surprisingly faithful to the arcade game's. Good stuff!\n\nAnd if you like Snow Bros., also be sure to check out Nightmare in the Dark. It's basically Snow Bros. for the Neo Geo with Halloween graphics. https://youtu.be/bQNkUDMjch4\n\n__\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vcDn6dAlFWo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vcDn6dAlFWo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vcDn6dAlFWo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Snow Bros.
