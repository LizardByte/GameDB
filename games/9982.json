You are a budding entrepreneur, whose hotel is rather unfortunately located within the territory of Tarnation Tadstock, the Texas Tyrant. Your only defense against Tadstock\u2019s army of seagulls, rats, yetis, and more is to build your hotel as quickly and intelligently as possible, using an array of increasingly sophisticated weapons.\n\nThe beautiful artwork, quirky storyline, and frantic gameplay all work seamlessly together with a generative music system, which creates original music depending on the player\u2019s actions and decisions. The player becomes a composer, creating complex musical structures to defend their hotel. A vast variety of music can be generated, from delicate beach chillout to country banjo techno.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 4021, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DT2OlB-SyYo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT2OlB-SyYo", "title": "Bad Hotel Steam Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DT2OlB-SyYo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
