The puzzles consist of Rube Goldberg contraptions with wrong or missing parts, and the player must figure out the correct replacements - from basic devices such as pulleys and ramps to absurd objects like elephants, cannons and boxing gloves. \n \nThree game modes are available: in the first, you pick a goal for your contraption, and your job is to fill in the basic mechanisms; the second puts you in charge of the \"Zany Objects\". The real challenge lies in third mode (Contraption Mix-Up), which takes you through a sequence of puzzles, complete with a time limit and a scoring system - the fewer mistakes you make, the more points you earn. Each sub-game can be played in two difficulty levels, and there's also a tutorial which explains (and demonstrates) how the basic mechanisms work.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/creative-contraptions", "videos": [{"id": 27813, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "TJrJRp3rFM4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJrJRp3rFM4", "title": "Old Game - Creative Contraptions (DOS) (1985)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TJrJRp3rFM4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
