{"id": "r8Fy1bLkCuA", "snippet": {"title": "Scarlet Nexus - Exclusive Official Animation & Gameplay Trailer | Summer of Gaming 2020", "description": "In Scarlet Nexus, you take on the role of Yuito Sumeragi, a new recruit to the Other Suppression Force (OSF) aiming to become an elite psionic like the one who saved him as a child. Armed with a talent in psycho-kinesis, you will explore the futuristic city of New Himuka and uncover the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities.\n\nScarlet Nexus combat is front and center in this Scarlet Nexus gameplay trailer. Watching Yuito slice, dice, and wield his psionic powers to weaponize the environment to bring down The Others is on full display in this next gen action game. But combat and Scarlet Nexus gameplay isn\u2019t the only thing to look out for in this Scarlet Nexus trailer. It also shows off the game\u2019s slick animation art style and gives players a more frightening look at the game\u2019s villains, The Others. Constantly tortured by their endless mutation, The Others feast on the brains of the living to calm their pain- and they must be stopped.\n\nFor more on Scarlet Nexus (the new game from Bandai Namco), stay tuned to IGN.\n\nThanks for checking out IGN's Summer of Gaming!
