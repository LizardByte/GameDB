World War II has finally ended and celebrations continue\u2026 Yet, somewhere in the middle of New Mexico, a secret intricate plot to extinguish humanity has been unraveling for a long time. Even if it could be stopped, what hope is there when inexplicably, no one can remember a thing? Tonight, step into Betty\u2019s shoes and find out exactly what happens at \u20183 Minutes to Midnight\u2019.\u201d \nImagine, if you will, being woken in the middle of the night by a deafening sound and the entire house shaking to its core.

Any thoughts you may harbor about running away, well, since you don\u2019t even know where you are, where would you run to. Hmm? \n \nInstead, let\u2019s presume you\u2019re made of sterner stuff and begin searching for an explanation. Maybe someone nearby will give you the answers you seek or even go far as to offer some insight of their own. Either way, you can only hope that whatever caused the ringing in your ears is the only thing that goes bump in the night\u2026 \n \nLet\u2019s be honest though, that\u2019s not how these things tend to pan out, is it?", "summary": "3 Minutes to Midnight is Scarecrow Studio \u2019s first adventure game with its development led by Jan Serra It is a classic point-and-click adventure game telling the story of Betty Anderson.
