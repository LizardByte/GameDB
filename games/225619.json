However, this period coincided with the video game crash of 1983 (following E.T.'s release in December 1982). During this crisis, numerous companies, including Parker Brothers, opted not to launch games that had already been developed for the Atari 2600. Consequently, The Incredible Hulk was never made available to the public.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-incredible-hulk--3"}
