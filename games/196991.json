Then, for yet undiscovered reasons the sun started expressing unusual behavior with regular solar flares and massive CMEs on a scale we never experienced before. These effects essentially destroyed our electrical infrastructure on the surface, and the lingering disturbance in the electromagnetic field makes regular means of communication unreliable. To conquer these challenges and to restore the infrastructure, our mechanical engineers updated our general purpose robot (ALAN series) with heavy shielding and additional hardware that we may require.\n\nYour task (as our only engineer on location with background in automation) is to make these units fully autonomous and self-sustaining because remote communication is not guaranteed at any point. For this task, you can build the microcontroller for ALAN-13 by using our tried and tested GENESIS components. Furthermore, you have to equip the robot with the right set of peripherals for any given mission.", "summary": "An isometric puzzle game, that makes you think like a programmer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alan-13-reformation", "videos": [{"id": 71616, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "f8mpVREUdUA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8mpVREUdUA", "title": "ALAN-13 Reformation trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f8mpVREUdUA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
