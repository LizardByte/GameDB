The hack contains all-new levels, custom graphics, objects, enemies, and music. The player begins in a grim-looking version of Peach's Castle. Most level entrances are still present, but they are explored in a different order and do not always go to equivalent areas in the original game.\n\nThe game's levels are also interconnected, with many levels containing entrances to other levels in addition to their regular entrance found in Peach's Castle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-64-1-dot-5-ztar-attack", "videos": [{"id": 37591, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "MRvVnajtjh0"}]}
