There is also a built-in level construction set.\n\nEach level can have different set of paddles - sometimes one at the bottom and one at the top, sometimes one left and one at the bottom, sometimes three stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay.\n\nThere are power-ups (question-marks falling out of destroyed blocks), unbreakable blocks, monster generators and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through.\n\nAfter a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/traz"}
