The story takes place in a new \"Kowloon City\", composed of nine districts. Here, tradition and modernity collide and blend together, creating a unique retro atmosphere that feels both bizarre and motley. But of course, in the corners where street light doesn't shine, bewilderingly changeable dark forces are surging. You will play the part of a \"film director\", forming your group of \"staff\", traversing the diverse scenery of the nine districts where order and chaos coexist. You will gather clues under the guise of \"filming\" to gradually uncover the hidden truth of this city.\n\nYou can pick the gender of the MC, and MC is a (film) director (so you will be referred to as \"Director\").\nThe playable cast is a mix of women and men, with the guy characters all being ikemen.
