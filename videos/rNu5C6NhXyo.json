Stars, movies, television shows, park attractions: no matter how obscure, if you can think of it, it'll probably show up over the course of the 30 episodes included in the double-disc set. \n\nEvery question is fully voiced, many of them use lengthy, high-quality video clips to provide clues, and since it's a Disney product, it's safe to assume that they aren't just throwaway fluff.
