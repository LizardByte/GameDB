Even with the introduction of friendly robot masters, there are still a lot of places where help is needed.\n\nAnd that is where you come in: a prototype built in the image of Megaman, designed to fill in the gaps and provide support in areas Megaman can't be. As of now, you just finished development and must complete a series of \"dry runs\" to ensure that you are up to the task of defending the city.\n\nDo you have what it takes?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/megaman-makeshift", "videos": [{"id": 132341, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "0C0yDdMeYPA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0yDdMeYPA", "title": "Megaman Makeshift Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0C0yDdMeYPA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
