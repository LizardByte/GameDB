Specifically, the Grand Fall entails the violent collision of twin planets Inferia and Celestia. The two planets, face one another, separated by the Orbus Barrier. Interaction between the two planets has been infrequent over the last few centuries despite their proximity; the Bridge of Light linked Inferia and Celestia in the distant past, but the link has been severed for an extensive period of time. The Aurora War, an ancient conflict that set Inferia against Celestia over two thousand years ago, continues to generate persistent mistrust between the two groups. The Orbus Barrier has shown recent signs of weakening and possible collapse due to the actions of an unknown external force. The journey takes Reid across both planets, as he seeks out those responsible for this movement towards the brink of annihilation.", "summary": "Tales of Eternia is an action japanese role playing game, with real time battle scenes (combos and spells can be assigned to the face buttons). It is a port of the original PS1 game, which was localized as Tales of Destiny II in the US (not to be confused with the Japanese Exclusive title Tales of Destiny 2, an actual sequel to Tales of Destiny)\n\nThe game is set in the fantasy world of Inferia, follows the story of a young hunter named Reid Hershel and his friends, Farah and Keele, as they meet a mysterious girl who speaks an unknown language. Their subsequent quest to discover her origins leads them across a dimensional boundary to an entirely different realm known as Celestia, where they become involved in an age-old conflict between the two worlds.\n\nIt would later inspire a 13-episode anime co-produced by Production I.G loosely based on the game's plot.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-eternia", "videos": [{"id": 138728, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "Fxf4axdIItY"}], "collections": [{"id": 269, "name": "Tales"}]}
