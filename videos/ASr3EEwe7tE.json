This was a highly-requested change that we were fortunately able to accommodate. Overworld/battle UI has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nYou can buy items from any shop in bulk. A counter will display and allows the player to buy multiple items, assuming you have inventory space and are able to afford them.\n\nBikes are back and this time all party members are eventually able to use them via a momentum-based system! This works well in conjunction with the running mechanic. As an added bonus, bikes are able to be delivered straight to you by calling Punk-Sure, the bike shop.\n\nPlus, many more returning and new features are in the works...\n\nThank you for your patience and support as we continue development.
