Exclusively in this version, players must acquire and use certain tools to overcome obstacles (although the use of such tools is constrained by an energy meter), and are encouraged to finish levels as fast as possible, but must be careful not to arouse too much suspicion from Muntz's dogs, who patrol the jungle and will engage Carl and Russell in battle if they move around too often.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/up--3"}
