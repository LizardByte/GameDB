It is based on the French comic series Asterix and Obelix. The player fights as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the 'might' of the oppressive Roman Empire. Asterix includes a variety of humorous fighting moves, which are demonstrated in the game's attract mode. The artwork and feel of Asterix remains true to its French source material, and the game's many humorous touches (such as the way defeated Legionnaires crawl away) will be instantly familiar to fans of the comic-book and cartoon series. Bonus levels - such as the chariot race that awaits at the end of the first level - introduce different gameplay elements to provide a break from the fighting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/asterix-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 33145, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "-LhEovW4Uqw"}, {"id": 89771, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QhD1DlP5YL0"}]}
