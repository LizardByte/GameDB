Perhaps known best for his physical play, Bill Laimbeer was the cornerstone of the Detroit Pistons 'Bad Boys' era of NBA basketball, Lending his likeness to a game that encouraged futuristic combat and checking that more resembles hockey, Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball is nonetheless an easy to pick up, but hard to master game.\n\nUnlike any other basketball game (besides Arch Rivals), Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball encourages foul play. There are no fouls for shoving or goaltending. It is pure point and shoot basketball at its element. Using an unusual top-down perspective gives the players more show, but it makes the gameplay sometimes feel like a great big air hockey table. The RADAR allows you to know where your position players are. Powerups, credits, weapons, and mines litter the court as well. Play wisely and you will accumulate credits easily to build a team of robotic basketball shoving checking punching Laimbeer superstars.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun in my opinion, it's a bit easy at first but it can be challenging once you start to recognize that the CPU will do its best to intercept incoming shots. There's only one button to use, it pushes, it shoves, it passes, it shoots. I enjoyed playing this game though, and it is fun to have a team full of Bill Laimbeers rocking and cruising all over the court, with nothing to stop us mwa ha ha ha what are you going to do about it Michael Jordan, become a billionaire by putting your face on everything and hocking anything you can get your hands on?\n\nScotty Pippen.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't figure out how to edit the Super Division and Division 1 and 2 names, so here are some cast-offs that I wanted to use:\n\nVelvet Mafia\nFive Guys\nBilderbergGRP\nTheIlluminati\nWhoseAGoodDog\nKane Tiberium\nTheIconsOfSin\nThe ATeam\nNewWorldOrder\nCAPPlaneteers\nThe Warriors\n\nAlas, these names shall be relegated to be used later in other projects perhaps...\n\nwww.patreon.com/L1011Widebody\n\nBill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball was developed by Hudson Soft.
