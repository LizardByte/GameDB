Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire brings you back to Arulco. The population is being terrorized by a reckless army. In the meantime the main export goods are drugs. Subversion and fraudulence has infiltrated all levels of local government and the ever-present Mafia has his fingers in many pies.\n\nYou are working undercover on behalf of the US government and your goal is to destroy the mighty drug cartel. You'll need a skilled hand to put together the right team of mercenaries and the negotiating skills of a diplomat to get the sceptical population on to your side. You'll also need the strategic genius of a general and the fighting tactics of a guerilla.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jagged-alliance-2-wildfire", "videos": [{"id": 93805, "video_id": "WVSybBDLIIA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVSybBDLIIA", "title": "Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WVSybBDLIIA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
