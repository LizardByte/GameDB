It was developed and published by Culture Brain in 1994.\n\nThe game is a standard martial arts one-on-one fighter in most respects, though features a few uncommon aspects. The first of which is that the player's health bar does not replenish after each round, and the fight continues as each bar is depleted. The second is that the player can recover from losing all their health if they have enough on their power (or qi) gauge. The game counts to three, like in professional wrestling, and the player has the chance to recover a small amount of health in exchange for their power.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 62947, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kceSbTjqzYI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kceSbTjqzYI", "title": "SNES Longplay [425] Ossu!!
