Download and play it right now!\n\nhttp://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=25569\nhttp://endarchy.com/\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/endarchy\n\nHere's my review of it:\n\nJust finished the first level, and I can say that this is a must-play release!\n\nNew level with new textures and atmosphere. These new textures fit into IdTech4 engine well!\n\nThe gameplay is cool: some demon and zombie hunting action, some searching for a way to advance, even some friendly marines!\n\nI really liked the \"that demon just never gave up!\" joke :D\n\nThere is also a cool new GUI, including the endlevel screen which shows your achievements and challenges.\n\nFinished the whole mod. Levels 2 and 3 offered some spectacular fights and the ending was very, very enjoyable!\n\nThe difficulty balance is excellent. I chose normal and it was challenging, but never too much - I didn't die, which I really like. Lowering the chance of ImpJumpHit is a great idea! Also reusing one NPC from the beginning of the game as a crazy guy was a clever idea! In the end, I started to hear that the \"repairer\" is answering to him and thought \"Oh, I'm going crazy, too!\" :D\n\nThe only flaw is that friendly marines are too unforgiving for my taste - hit them once and they hate you. I think that's too much, because it's too easy to accidentally hit one of them during an intense firefight - they must understand it, but they don't :(\n\nThe design shows excellent atmosphere of underground bunker.\n\nIn the end, the mod left me very pleased :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNkKohN6_lc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNkKohN6_lc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNkKohN6_lc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNkKohN6_lc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNkKohN6_lc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doom 3 mod Endarchy - level 1", "description": "Great mod!
