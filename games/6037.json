Players control the eponymous bear as they use various things to earn \"nasty Points\", with extra points being given for random missions.\n\nThe game is set on a paradisal island where teddy bears live in harmony. The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children's television show host.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naughty-bear-panic-in-paradise", "videos": [{"id": 2279, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sTz92Si3fOI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTz92Si3fOI", "title": "Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise - Trailer (official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sTz92Si3fOI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
