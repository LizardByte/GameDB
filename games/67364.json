Egg Monster Hero was released on the Nintendo DS in Japan on March 24, 2005, and was the first game Square Enix published for that console. Players primarily interact using the stylus to drag Egg Monsters towards the enemy and perform special attacks. A mobile phone version of the game became available in Japan on June 6. The game was intended for a North American release but ultimately canceled due to poor reception by focus groups. It was the 141st best-selling game of 2005 in Japan, selling 92,096 copies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/egg-monster-hero", "videos": [{"id": 93526, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nvAWzEOREeA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvAWzEOREeA", "title": "Egg Monster Hero Japanese TV Commercial (Nintendo DS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nvAWzEOREeA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 93527, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CUq3bQU5CbY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUq3bQU5CbY", "title": "Egg Monster Hero for Nintendo DS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUq3bQU5CbY/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7642, "name": "Hanjuku Hero"}]}
