Triggered by the device, a mechanism is activated and the hammer may be released, leading to the breaking of the vial and potential harm to the cat.\n\nUntil you dare to open the box, the cat exists in this fantastical state where it's both alive and dead at the same time.\n\nSo, embrace the madness, my little one, as we venture into the quantum circus of uncertainty!", "summary": "Schrodinger's Cat Experiment is a Brazilian indie game in pixel art that combines brain-teasing puzzles with enchanting aesthetics and feline charm.
