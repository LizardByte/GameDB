Pairs of differently colored blocks fall into a well. The player must arrange them so that three identically colored blocks are touching in order to eliminate them. The floor of the well is staggered such that a block can be touching two other blocks on each side (in addition to a block above and a block below). Additionally, the floor is tilted at an angle. Blocks are affected by gravity and slide off of each other in the direction of the tilt after they are placed. The player can change the tilt of the floor at any time, which causes the blocks to shift around. A block also falls when placed over an empty space or when the block below it is eliminated. Players can use the effect of gravity to create chain reactions where one set of eliminated blocks causes another set to be eliminated, and the ability to change the tilt of the floor can be used to induce reactions by shifting falling blocks before they land.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-slider"}
