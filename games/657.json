The game combines Arthurian lore, Norse mythology and Irish Celtic legends with a dash of high fantasy. It is set in the period after King Arthur's death and his kingdom has split into three parts which are in a constant state of war with each other.\nDAoC includes both Player versus Environment (PvE) and Realm versus Realm (RvR) combat. Players can choose to adventure alone or join groups. Players may also join battlegroups, which are formed so all members are able to get completion of credit in large-scale PvE encounters and for communication purposes in RvR.", "videos": [{"id": 644, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Th-yov-jENM"}, {"id": 31151, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-D9UO0OyYsg"}, {"id": 31152, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1YRW6Xq03eo"}]}
