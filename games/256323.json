He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.", "summary": "Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as \"Examine\" or \"Talk\" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the \"Move\" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.\n\nMost of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kagami-no-kuni-no-legend", "videos": [{"id": 93561, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P_IO2Ecvbo4"}]}
