In this point and click game, the player takes Stanley through the house and out into his backyard to hunt for the missing things. There are many clickable animations and walk-on characters who dole out snippets of information about sharks and other sea creatures. As in Playhouse Disney: Stanley Tiger Tales, clicking on some objects takes Stanley into his imagination, where he pretends to be anything from a penguin sliding on the snow to a sting ray navigating around obstacles on the ocean floor.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
