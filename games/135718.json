The game follows the stories of Blazing Sword\u2019s cast between the end of Blazing Sword and the beginning of its Japanese-only follow-up, Fire Emblem: Binding Blade. It was originally inspired by the BSFE games, and Arch\u2019s personal reading of 1001 Arabian Nights (hence the title).\n\nThe story centers around several different \u201ctales,\u201d which are are similar to a standard Fire Emblem chapter. The main difference, however, is that each tale is completely independent. The cast of the first tale will not carry over into the second, and while some do link together (for example, Tales 1, 2, and 3 provide the backdrop for Tale 5\u2019s events), the plots are independent of each other. At the center of the game is a hub, the \u201cTale Select,\u201d which also grants access to view Achievements, Bonus Content, toggle the difficulty settings, and, of course, choose a tale to play/replay.\n\nThe classic Fire Emblem elements are all intact. Each unit has a personality and a story which contributes their unique characteristics to the overall tale. Although unit deaths are not permanent (if a unit dies in a tale, when you replay that tale the character will return), the tactical choices you make have an effect on the outcome of the stories. All of Blazing Sword\u2019s surviving playable cast (and some of its non-playable cast) make an appearance, with some guest appearances by Binding Blade and Immortal Sword characters.\n\nElibean Nights features a total of 16 playable maps, 19 achievements, and plenty of new story content. The final standard chapter was completed in 2014, but development of additional bonus features continued until final cancellation in 2019.", "videos": [{"id": 38499, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-G9koFvCPHY"}, {"id": 38500, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "InFlIOUzxQw"}]}
