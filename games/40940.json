Again your in control of a tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces...\n\nThis time you must collect smart bombs to finish the game. You need to collect all of them: 16 smart bombs.\n\nAvoid bad stuff for landing like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an \"?\" awaiting you: sometimes helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and soon) - other times they're traps too.\n\nExcellent parallax-scrolling, nice graphics and sounds will give you a great time with this one, easy to play - but damn' hard to win!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/re-bounder"}
