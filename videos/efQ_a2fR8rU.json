Every life will play out differently, with different enemies to face, items to find and power-ups to collect.\n\nSurvival requires you to be stealthy and VR is the perfect match for this. Sneaking around and hiding behind cover; it's second nature in VR to just lean round or peek over cover to gain the advantage.\n\nYour friends can also help out by connecting to the game with their phone or tablet and hacking into the ships computer.
