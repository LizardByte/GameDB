In order to do that, he needs to pass through three zones, the garden, the forest and the castle, defeating Kings' followers and buying upgrades from the other Popgoes Animatronics. When King Cultivate is defeated, he calls Popgoes evil and claims, that without Kings' help, they will all starve.", "summary": "In Popgoes Arcade, you play as a child. You\u2019re not going to be killed by a mysterious man, you\u2019re not going to be stuffed into a suit or given a mask to wear in purgatory. No. Today, you\u2019re just going to play a damn game on a top-of-the-line Popgoes Pizzeria arcade machine. You\u2019re going to play Weasel World. Your favourite. But Weasel World feels\u2026 strange today. It plays the same, it looks the same, it... smells the same... But there\u2019s just something wrong about it. And with your little hand at the joystick, you WILL find out what that something is. Until your parents come to pick you up, of course."}
