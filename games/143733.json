Do you want to watch helplessly as our hedgehog friend rolls backwards down the same slope for the fifth time in a row? Do you want to experience the fear and frustration of Chemical Plant Zone Act 2's rising water section as though you were playing it for the very first time? Well, my friend, look no further than SNOLF: The Sonic Golf Experience!\n\nThis romhack replaces Sonic's ability to move with a golf-game mechanic, similar to the kind of thing found in games like Kirby's Dream Course. Sonic remains rolled up into a ball under most conditions, and can only be launched when he has come to a stop. The Rings counter instead counts how many shots you have taken, allowing players to compete to get the lowest score!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
