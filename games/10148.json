"storyline": "Night In The Woods is a VIDEO GAME. All Mae wants to do is run around with her friends, break stuff and hang on to a life of aggressive aimlessness. She dropped out of college and returned home to her crumbling old mining town to do just that, but she's finding that nothing is the same anymore. The old town seems different. Her old friends have grown in their own directions. Mae herself is undergoing some sudden and unexplained changes, giving her mysterious abilities that grant her access to a side of town she never knew existed.\nThe world is changing, things are ending, and the future is uncertain. Up behind the park at the edge of town, back in the trees by the old mine- there's something in the woods. And it could mean no future at all.\nNight In The Woods comes from a deep place for us. That point where you sense things are changing and it's time to move on but you just don't know how. Knowing that everything will end someday, and wondering how well we'll be able to meet it when it happens. How long we'll be able to hold on, and when we should let go. When to accept and when to fight.", "summary": "Night In The Woods is an adventure game heavily focused on story, characters and exploration, with some platforming to get around town. Mae's a cat so the roofs and ledges and powerlines are all her playground, and she's not the only one up there by a long shot. You'll also be doing various activities and interacting with the world in different ways, getting to know the townspeople, hanging out with friends, exploring Possum Springs inside and out, and venturing into the surrounding areas.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-in-the-woods", "videos": [{"id": 11446, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "u17kM8oSz3k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u17kM8oSz3k", "title": "Night In The Woods Trailer - NEW DATE: FEBRUARY 21st", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u17kM8oSz3k/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 67169, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "eEErDK1FJtI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEErDK1FJtI", "title": "Night In The Woods Trailer (2014)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eEErDK1FJtI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 121341, "name": "E3 2019 Trailer", "video_id": "dOzYag3sNyg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzYag3sNyg", "title": "Night in the Woods - E3 2019 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOzYag3sNyg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
