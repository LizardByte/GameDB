Learn the ways of the nature, the mountains and caves, snow-filled tundras and seren lakes.

Walk through the landscapes, interact with the environment and learn based of the choices you make. Explore the different roads presented and enjoy the sound and sights of the world.\n\nStar Sky 2 continues the story set by the previous one, with a similar style of gameplay. There are more choices and most importantly, more consequences. Learn from the choices you make, and see the different paths a life can take, and the scenarios that unfold. The game is a slow experience meant as a way to get lost in you thoughts, to feel the game as you are playing, and most importantly, to simply relax.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-sky-2", "videos": [{"id": 7589, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IK6-vuUaMRo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK6-vuUaMRo", "title": "Star Sky 2 - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IK6-vuUaMRo/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2104, "name": "star sky"}]}
