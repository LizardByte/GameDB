You control Michito, who stays in an abandoned facility, keeping watch over a mysterious girl in a chamber. The game does not feature a traditional Nexus, but rather a linear starting area that branches out as the player explores further. There is also a health system wherein the player will be woken up if they're caught by chasers too many times.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shirube-no-kazari"}
