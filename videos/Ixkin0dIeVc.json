In the campaign, players get to rule over influential historical cities filled with magnificent monuments.\nGameplay\nFrom plowing fields to creating products, players must oversee the manufacturing of agriculture and goods for the city population. Players have an arsenal of tools to optimize their objectives. In addition, a maximum overview of their city helps players to solve problems and prevent population loss. Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s gameplay is geared towards all types of players: from beginners of the genre to experienced strategists.\nCampaign\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s main campaign contains 16 historical missions covering the colonization of ancient lands to the conquest of Babylon by Persians in 6th Century BC. Each mission summons a different time period in Ancient Mesopotamian history. Players must carry out tasks important to the specific time and place of each mission, including the construction of historical monuments.\nMonuments\nDuring the campaign players will not only build complex ancient monuments, but design them too. Nebuchadnezzar features an in-game \u201cmonument editor\u201d giving players complete control over their buildings. From structural design to color scheme to final details: it\u2019s in the hands of the player. Will you recreate history or make history? It\u2019s up to you.\nMods & Localization\nNebuchadnezzar was created with mods and localization in mind. Modders will be able to create their own buildings, goods, and monuments. And in addition, they can invent new missions and campaigns. All definition files are written in the easy to read Lua language. Localizing mods will not be a problem. You can create mods in multiple languages and/or add languages to existing ones. This applies to the base game as well.\n\n\n\n\u2605Strategy and Real Time Strategy Games gameplay you may like:\n\u25baStrategy Games Gameplay:\nhttp://bit.ly/Strategy-Gameplay\n\u25baReal Time Strategy Games Gameplay:\nhttp://bit.ly/RTS-Gameplay\n\n\n\n\u2693SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBE-YouTube\n\ud83d\udc51YT MEMBERSHIPS: http://bit.ly/YT-Memberships\n\ud83c\udf7bDISCORD: https://discord.gg/BpTBZm4\n\ud83d\udc55MERCH: https://teespring.com/stores/sergiuhelldragoonhq", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ixkin0dIeVc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ixkin0dIeVc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ixkin0dIeVc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ixkin0dIeVc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ixkin0dIeVc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nebuchadnezzar - Official Trailer", "description": "More Strategy Games Trailers: http://bit.ly/Strategy-Trailers\n\u2605Buy Cheap Games https://www.g2a.com/r/buy-crusader-kings-3\n(* Use SHD code for 3% CASHBACK.
