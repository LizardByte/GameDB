In its heart it still is simple to play car chase game where player must escape cops and avoid hitting anything, one bump and it is game over. But with endless, procedurally generated levels, options to play both portrait or horizontal view, secret locations and lots of other surprises it offers different, new fresh take on the original car chase game that started it all. It is not a sequel like Pako 2, but more of a refined, remixed version of the original Pako and its best parts.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pako-forever", "videos": [{"id": 29190, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xeR0IqCjANQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeR0IqCjANQ", "title": "PAKO Forever", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xeR0IqCjANQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
