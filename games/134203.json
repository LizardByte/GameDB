Then, someone had superb thought to use PICO-8 for that. Retro feel and ease of use that came with this tool took us right away while technological constraints made it an intriguing design challenge. \n \nThanks to the PICO-8 community and zep for creating such an amazing tool. You guys made working on PICOHOT a blast! \n \nWHAT'S THERE: \n- SUPERHOT\u2019s \u201ctime moves only when you move\u201d mechanic. \n- The Basic SUPERHOT three-color palette for clarity. \n- It\u2019s 3D! \n- A few story levels and an endless mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
