We start things off on the Green Planet, featuring the Tallest Tree Ever.\r\n\r\nBucky O'Hare is based off a graphic novel and cartoon show featuring an alternate universe involved in a war between mammals and toads.  The toads are winning.  The gameplay is pretty much ripped off from Mega Man, but hey, at least they're ripping off the best.\r\n\r\nQuick note: I did this run in one take, after not having played the game in about a year.  So there are mistakes.  I kept them in (with one exception), because a lot of them are good \"what not to do\" examples.  \r\n\r\nAlso, there's a lot of \"skips\" in the video.  I don't know why.  If anyone has any tips on how to record better quality stuff, I'd appreciate hearing them (I currently record using VirtuaNES, convert it to .avi, then split it up using Windows Movie Maker).\r\n\r\nCommentary:\r\n\r\n0:06 - An overlong backstory.  Short version: The toads kidnapped your crew and put each member on a different planet.  Bucky, having evaded the toads using a bad pun and his Main Character Shield, needs to rescue them.\r\n1:00 - You can choose the stages in any order...almost.  Do NOT do Blue before Green...you can go there, but you will be stuck.  The best order is Green-Yellow-Red-Blue, so that's what I do here.  Oh, I let it go so long on this screen because I was watching the Toad Mothership in the middle.  Never really noticed it moving around before.\r\n1:22 - Your main character, Bucky, can shoot in all 4 directions (you need to jump to shoot down).  Also, he can charge up for a super-jump by holding B.  I show off his moves a bit before moving on.\r\n1:30 - 1up icons give you an extra life.  Well, duh.  You also get a 1-up for every 10000 points.  This game hands out 1ups like candy...Before I even leave this screen, I'll have earned another one on points.\r\n1:35 - These yellow coins give 3000 points.\r\n1:51 - The heart-shaped L's give you an extended life meter (2 max you out).  They also give 3000 points.  If you have to continue, you go back down to your base life level.  \r\n2:45 - Those lighter green branches fall when you step on them.  The darker ones are safe.\r\n2:50 - The P coins increase your power meter.  The bigger it is, the longer you can charge, and therefore the higher your jump.  Each character has their own power meters (with different abilities), and they stay raised even if you continue.  Again, 2 of them maxes you out.\r\n2:55 - These swings are tricky.  Jump when both swings are on the right.  It doesn't look like it's supposed to work that way, but it does.\r\n3:05 - These pulleys are just like the ones in Super Mario Bros...bring them too low, they fall.  Keep that in mind.\r\n3:17 - Touching the water kills you, even if it's flowing off the edge.  This is an irritating way to die, so when you're dropping, go to the other side.  Crouch when shooting the fish to avoid charging your jump up by mistake.  And you can jump off to get the 3000-point coin or the 1-up, but it's Not Worth It (tm).\r\n3:37 - Both these branches fall.  Jump quick.\r\n3:50 - I don't usually go for this 1-up, but I was feeling frisky.  Note how getting hit cancels your charge.  It also stops your jumps, causing you to fall straight down.  That'll cause a good number of deaths.\r\n3:58 - Dodge rocks, shoot like crazy to kill flowers for points, hope you get lucky and grab some powerups on the way.\r\n4:21 - The greatest danger here is getting shot while jumping over a hole.\r\n4:42 - ...See?\r\n4:58 - I wanted to demonstrate again...the encoding is a little wonky, so it's hard to tell, but trust me, I got hit.\r\n5:30 - ride the ships over to the Power coin.  ALWAYS go after the Power coins if you can.  Remember, even if you die, even if you continue, you keep them.\r\n5:35 - Your first boss: T-T-T-TOADBORG! (Yes, that's how you say it).  Don't let him drop the giant rock on you, it kills you right out.  To avoid it, either stand close to him, or just walk through him.  When he smashes the wall, you can shoot him.  Repeat until he blows up.\r\n6:36 - This is Blinky.  He thinks he's people.  He's also the most useful crew member.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHHM7_pBjUw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHHM7_pBjUw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHHM7_pBjUw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Bucky O'Hare NES Walkthrough Part 1", "description": "Bucky O'Hare for the NES, part one.
