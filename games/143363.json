The add-on features Caleb interacting with a failed writer named Maximilian \"Max\" Dunkel, who attempts to commit suicide after never actually writing his much anticipated upcoming book. Before he can do it however, he is approached by a man in the black suit representing \"Prospero Publishing\", who hands him an eerie typewriter to finish the book. Grateful, Max asks him what he can do to repay him, and the man in the black suite asks him to do \"one small thing\" for him.\n\nIt was one of the first major Blood add-ons to feature new multimedia assets, requiring the, at least temporary, overwriting of existing ones. This technique was later used in add-ons such as Bloody Pulp Fiction. The beta release featured thirteen levels spread over three episodes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodlines", "videos": [{"id": 45433, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6-adEUEMDwg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-adEUEMDwg", "title": "Bloodlines TC for Blood", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-adEUEMDwg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
