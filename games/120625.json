Scientists adopted a means in which the human brain was removed and surgically encased into a robotic armature; a process known as Integration. It was meant to be a temporary solution to an unavoidable crisis.\n\nIt was a good thing for decades, allowing humans to survive. But some of the Integrated saw this new form as the future of humanity. With no desire to reverse the process, the post-humanist Integrated stratified, calling themselves the Rayonne. Global war soon erupted, and Rayonne forces now seek to hunt down any remaining humans, forcing their integration, and destroying those who don\u2019t share their views.", "summary": "In Disintegration, you play an Integrated character named Romer. He\u2019s one of many who rebelled and are now outlawed by the Rayonne.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to lead a small group of these Outlaws, people who have chosen to fight back and survive, into a brighter future where we protect those they care about and hope to one day become human again.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 28686, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "y_BUCW9rhNA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_BUCW9rhNA", "title": "Disintegration Announce Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_BUCW9rhNA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 29482, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "f0AeSDjUVjs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0AeSDjUVjs", "title": "Disintegration Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f0AeSDjUVjs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33212, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hBrnP4-3waw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBrnP4-3waw", "title": "Disintegration - Technical Beta Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hBrnP4-3waw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 37163, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IXaKic29CLk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXaKic29CLk", "title": "Disintegration Developer Presentation - Future Games Show", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IXaKic29CLk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
