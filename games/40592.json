You have to dodge the other cars with your Formula 1 car to become first in that Grand Prix. Its cool though how day and night and the weather changes. It\u00b4s from the famous \"Quelle\" games (Quelle was a big german mail order company that also made video games for the Atari 2600). Although Super-Ferrari is a rip off of the racing game \"Enduro\" by Activision it\u00b4s fun to play. \n \nQuelle games are in Europe and especially in Germany highly unpopular amongst collectors. Interesting fact: James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, owns at least one of those games."}
