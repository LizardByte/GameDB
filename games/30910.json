Bottomless ditches of death. And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned psycho-lunatic lady. Thankfully, you are otherwise granted the ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. Survival in the game demands meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions. Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back. It's a game of control or be controlled."}
