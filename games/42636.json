The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appear. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-doh-it-again", "videos": [{"id": 36734, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tZXt13Ay_Bc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZXt13Ay_Bc", "title": "Arkanoid: Doh It Again - Super Nintendo / Super Famicom - VGDB", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZXt13Ay_Bc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
