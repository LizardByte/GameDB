You are a mole armed with a wide range of different weapons; from shovel all the way to the rocket launcher and nuclear grenade. Your only purpose is to kill the other moles or at least hurt them as much as possible before you die. The player with most kills wins! \n \nMoleZ became almost legendary, at least in Finland. It started a whole new genre of \"side view underground dig & shoot deathmatch\" or real-time Worms-style games. Several clones (for example Liero) have been made from it since. \n \nMoleZ was originally released in 1997 under donation based licensing terms. It was re-released as freeware on christmas day in 1999.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
