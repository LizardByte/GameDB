The game also saw the introduction of the \"Crazy Hop\" feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they taxi passengers around the locations. By performing moves such as the \"Crazy Hop\" and the \"Crazy Dash\", the driver accumulates tips from their passengers, which increases the total score.\n\nThis sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem. The game also has some online modes in the form of a scoreboard, and replay-sharing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-taxi-2", "videos": [{"id": 20320, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "w1drRBR0Mt4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1drRBR0Mt4", "title": "Let's Play Crazy Taxi 2 Dreamcast HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1drRBR0Mt4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
