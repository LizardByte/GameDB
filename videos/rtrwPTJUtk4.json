A 1985 text adventure. Long ago, in times passed beyond remembrance, Solon the Master Wizard and wearer of the Secret Cloak lost the 13 Stars of Power. The grasping Vileroth believed the Stars to be the only source of Solon's expert wizardry. But, unbeknownst to Vileroth, it was the Secret Cloak that controlled the Stars and protected the wearer from their awesome powers. Unable to master the Stars, Vileroth was undone.\n\nIn his final days, as Vileroth's strength slipped from him, he concealed the 13 Stars of Power within the Castle of Claymorgue, determined that no one save he should possess them. Solon, learning of Vileroth's destruction, despatches his faithful young apprentice Beanwick to retrieve the Stars.\n\n\"Tread carefully, O Beanwick! Would that I could assume this quest myself, but alas, I can only send with you these few spells. Claymorgue Castle harbors further spells, but beware -- one unskilled in the arts cannot predict their outcome.\"\n\nFrom the recording originally sent by Rafal to http://www.rzxarchive.co.uk/ .
