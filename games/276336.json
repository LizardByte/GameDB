Create your very own team of helpers, mercenaries and apprentices, and head out on expeditions!\n\nIf a monster appears during an expedition, choose a card and attack! Will you use a Recovery Card? Maybe an Attack Card? Refine your strategy and fight wisely!\nMonsters feature Wind, Water, Lightning or Earth alignments, so choose a compatible weapon before taking on each enemy.\n\nOf course, each pilot's skills are also important. Develop your character with various training exercises, and learn new skills that will aid you while exploring this dangerous land!\n\nAt the fabled New World, you can join up with other players and go on expeditions. There are many powerful monsters, so you probably won't stand a chance on your own. Push forward by helping each other!\nSo, can you bring peace to the Uncivilized Land?\nGood luck!", "summary": "Skyforce Unite! is a management-simulation game by Kairosoft where you manage your flight crew and the planes.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skyforce-unite"}
