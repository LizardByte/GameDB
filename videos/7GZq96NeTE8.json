Use a combination of exploration and word puzzle gameplay to reshape reality and guide Tom through the course of three painful but transformative days of his life.\n\nOur thoughts shape our reality, and this is the central idea that the short narrative-puzzle game Unwording is based around.\n\nYou play as Tom, a lonely, average guy with a tendency to see the negative in everything. An empty bed to him - literally - spells loneliness, an empty phone inbox screams that no one likes him. Everywhere he looks, the world reinforces his negative thoughts back to him.\n\nUntil one day, he forgets to close his window and lets a little bird into his life.\n\nUnwording is a short puzzle game about happiness and gratitude. As the player, you live through 3 very different days of Tom's life, exploring his neighborhood and interpreting his thoughts through word puzzles. As his perception changes, his worldview widens, and you see more of the hidden dimensions of his life.\n\nTo share more would be to give everything away!\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: https://www.frostwoodinteractive.com/unwording\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frostwood_int\nEmail: armaan@frostwoodinteractive.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7GZq96NeTE8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7GZq96NeTE8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7GZq96NeTE8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7GZq96NeTE8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7GZq96NeTE8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Unwording - Updated Trailer", "description": "WISHLIST ON STEAM - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1974250/Unwording\n\nUnwording is a narrative puzzle game about happiness, gratitude, and the power of words.
