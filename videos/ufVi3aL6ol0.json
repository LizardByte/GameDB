In fact played through twice for the Ultimate ending. Not that I can understand a word of it ;)\n\nHere is a translation of all the text sequences in the game :- http://www.gamefaqs.com/genesis/565488-panorama-cotton/faqs/48405\n\nSome interesting effects in the game which change each stage so it never looks samey.  Some interesting fake 3d type effects echieved with sprite scaling and sharp 2d sprites ontop of the 3d ish tunnels look fantastic.   Alot of polish in this game, so good for a western audiance I guess ;)\n\nOnly niggle was with some of the spells.  You can activate normal spell function with C button which is fair enough, like any other shooter.  But for special version of that spell, you need to hold primary fire for a few seconds and then press it with c button. (you shots stop auto fring when charged waiting to see if you press c button for spell power). -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufVi3aL6ol0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufVi3aL6ol0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufVi3aL6ol0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufVi3aL6ol0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [181] Panorama Cotton", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nSo, I was looking on tinternet for another game that looks to have pushed the limits of the Genesis and came up with this rail shooter (or cute 'emup) released only in the Japanese market.\n\nIs with alot sega games, Hard mode played in order to unlock full ending.
