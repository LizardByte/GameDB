She can't remember anything about her past or herself. Not even her name. A boy finds her. A boy with a cloud of white hair wearing a green sweatshirt. They go up to the deck. There are other people there. Fifteen others. They remember more than the girl does. They remember who they are. The ship reaches an island. Everyone thinks they're safe.\n\nBut then the fox appears. The harbinger of despair. It tells them that they must kill each other. For every three days without a killing, the fox will execute someone at random. When someone is killed by another player, there will be a trial with a defense team, a prosecution team, and a jury. If the team that convinces the jury gets the killer wrong, the entire team-as well as the innocent person they fingered-is executed, and the killer escapes.\n\nThis is Foxy's killing game.\n\nOne way or another, people will die.\n\nDespair is the only escape.\n\nAnd out of the ashes...\n\n...a brilliant hope must be born.", "summary": "Danganronpa Forge:Re is a fan-made visual novel based on the Danganronpa and Ace Attorney series, which features pre-existing characters from various games and visual novels trapped on an island by Foxy and forcing them to play a life or death game.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/danganronpa-forge-re"}
