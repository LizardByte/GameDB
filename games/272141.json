Your mission is to reach the interior of the enemy space station orbiting our planet. Once inside you will receive new instructions.\n\nFirst you must infiltrate enemy territory on the back of your quad armed with a high performance cannon until you reach the point where our intelligence systems believe they have located a space aircraft. You must get your hands on it if it really exists. It is our only hope to reach space in time.\n\nIf you manage to get hold of the enemy airship, you will have to find out how it works, leave our planet and fly to the space station.", "summary": "2015 Game developed for the CPCRetroDev contest of that year as a personal challenge of its creator, Toni Ramirez. And even being a very respectable title, it underwent a major transformation, trying to enrich it, about five years later, as a final review in which more stages, enemies and some other substantial improvement were added, with the invaluable help of great musicians and graphic designers.\n\nBoth proposals honor their declared desire to pay homage to the legendary Army Moves and Navy Moves from Dinamic Software. That is, good graphics, good music, super addictive, with high difficulty levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-moves"}
