Abe must travel to the Soul Storm Brewery, stop those corporate villains and save the enslaved Mudokon workers.", "summary": "Abe thought he had saved the Mudokons from the evil Glukkons with the destruction of Rupture Farms. However, a new threat has arisen: the Glukkons who run Soul Storm Brewery have created an addictive drink made from Mudokon bones. To get all of the bones they need, Soul Storm has an army of Mudokon slaves excavating the Mudokon City of Death; when one of the slaves is worked to death, he becomes part of the product. The only person who can put a stop to this is Abe. You will guide Abe as he travels through the brewery and tries to destroy the boilers. Along the way, he must also try to save his people. Luckily, Abe can talk to his people and get them to help defeat the enemies and solve puzzles he faces along the way. Help Abe save the Mudokons in Oddworld Adventures 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oddworld-adventures-2", "videos": [{"id": 71613, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_-yR6oNYZOY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yR6oNYZOY", "title": "Oddworld Adventures 2 (GBC) Longplay/Walkthrough NO COMMENTARY HD 1080p", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_-yR6oNYZOY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
