Line up three or more of the same color to make them disappear. But don't make any mistaken clicks, or your bubbles will crack and lose color and you'll have to come up with another way to get rid of them. Inhale bubbles and pick a new place to drop them to create huge combos. The bubbles are always coming, so you'll have to be quick to clear the board.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pop-a-tronic"}
