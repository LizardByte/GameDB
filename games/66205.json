In that country, there was a princess named Puri Puri who was loved by everyone. On her 16th birthday, the King, Cocoa III had to decide on a marriage partner for his daughter. Puri Puri, who's dissatisfied with this custom, said, \"I will be the bride of the person who climbs the Tower of Nouveau in the eastern forest!\" The Tower of Nouveau is a forbidden tower with terrible complex traps and monsters. Cocoa III scolded Puri Puri for saying such things. The rumor spread far and wide and even reached the ears of the adventurer Totom who had explored various things in the past. He said, \"That's interesting, and I'm also interested in the Tower of Nouveau,\" and off he went to conquer the tower.", "summary": "This is an action puzzle game where you control a caveman climbing a tower. The tower is filled wit monsters and traps. Sometimes, what appears to be a solid piece of flooring as actually a hole, so stepping on it will cause you to fall. Monsters can be defeating by pounding your hammer on the floor tile above them, causing it to fall and crush them. The same process can be used to enter rooms that cannot be accessed any other way. The hammer can also be used to make floor tiles appear in order to cross a gap. However, the hammer has a limited number of uses, so you must be careful to use it correctly. In order to access the next floor, you must collect a crystal, which causes a ladder to appear.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pri-pri-primitive-princess", "videos": [{"id": 84615, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "eQoN4PVLD4w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQoN4PVLD4w", "title": "\u30d7\u30ea\u30d7\u30ea PRIMITIVE PRINCESS! \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eQoN4PVLD4w/sddefault.jpg"}]}
