Who is this? You must search the island for useful tools that will aid in your escape. As time passes and hopes of survival hang by a thread, you realise that this island is not as it seems. \n\nExplore an open sandbox environment which, depending on your intention, could have or could not have a foreseeable end. But as you investigate further, you may notice some suspicious activity including animals that would not normally be found in an area like this and some inconsistencies that lead to more questions. It is up to you to discover the answers.\n\nCraft items, quench your thirst, satisfy your hunger, fend off animals\u2026 What will you really need to escape the island? The answers are waiting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
