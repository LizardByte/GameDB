While these cartridges claimed to have hundreds or even thousands of games, most of the time the same games would be listed multiple times, or had their levels split up. But not the SUPER MEGA 256-IN-1! This virtual multicart contains completely different games, at least 4 of which are playable! But there's something off about it...\n\nHey, wait. There's something weird about this thing. Almost like... There's a person trapped inside it, yearning to be free. We need to save him. We need to collect the 5 Zodiac Crystals and release the tortured soul inside!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-mega-256-in-1"}
