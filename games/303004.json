Some were known to your great-grandparents, others will be discovered by your great-grandchildren. All of them once lived here or there, but now they find themselves in the Inbetween, existing as they cautiously explore their surroundings. Some are in search of a way to return to real life, others aim to uncover the mysteries of existence.\n\nUpon arriving in the Inbetween, each new hero starts their journey anew, as if from a blank slate. No matter who the hero was, the Inbetween changes itself for the new skull, creating a familiar, customary environment for them on its expanse, be it a home, cave, or an entire ocean.\n\nThus, surrounded by a river of molten lava amidst cemetery ruins, a grim castle as if alive grew, atop which a violinist plays his drama in vampiric solitude every night. In the gaping abyss of sea waves, the formidable ship destroyer Ursul unfolded his mighty reign. And hidden behind the dome of the sky is the peak of the great mountain Eo, where a fiery draconid hides from the world, guarding his priceless eye. Merging with a powerful artifact and since then enslaved, the Alchemist set up an entire laboratory in the name of the mission to gain freedom. And an old skeletal butler quietly manages the cemetery estates.\n\nThere is no death, as such, here. As new heroes keep arriving in the Inbetween, alliances begin to form among its inhabitants. Powerful teams are formed, which, using their strength, magic, and cunning, win power and authority in a world without death \u2014 in a world where the future is shrouded in mystery.", "summary": "\"GOLD OF SKULLS\" is a new Free-to-play, client-based collectible card game with NFT integration.
