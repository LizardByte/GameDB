The ultimate disc throwing video game experience. With a retro neon game style also called Synthwave or cyberpunk style. Your goal is to survive in a world of obstacles, where you are welcomed as its champion. As you move through this world, you will encounter all kinds of hexagons, which can be helpful or injurious. \n\nThe world consists of more than 0x2000 levels (a.k.a. parkour's), each generated through a seed which you can share with a friend or a foe to compete for the high score. Adding to the replayability.\n\nEvery seed generates a unique parkour by combining various handcrafted phases. These phases are displayed as tunnels or arenas and are seamlessly connected in many different orders and variations. All to create fast action paced gameplay mixed with more relaxed puzzle-like or transitional phases. \n\nThe various phases combined should provide a rich and impactful VR experience whilst also being quite the challenge.\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/DiscontinueVR\n\nTwitch\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/discontinuevr\n\nGame website\nhttps://postbeta.com/discontinue", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQkOTHo2zxY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQkOTHo2zxY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQkOTHo2zxY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQkOTHo2zxY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DQkOTHo2zxY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Discontinue Release Trailer by PostBeta #VRGame", "description": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061220/Discontinue/\n\n#VRGame #VirtualReality #Synthwave\n\nDiscontinue is a unique competitive Virtual Reality (VR) Arcade game.
