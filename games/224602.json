You have a device attached to your wrist, presenting two crucial health metrics: your body temperature and calorie level. Keep these levels up, and you\u2019ll continue to fight through the frost, making progress towards escape. But if they drop below a certain threshold, it could spell disaster, first causing detrimental health effects before you ultimately freeze to death.\n\nTo avoid a less-than-ideal fate, Les Stroud will help you with advice and tips on how to best survive in the freezing wild. Tools such as an improvised paddle, snow shoes, and hunting traps to catch game are all based on real-life survival tools. Challenges are based on actual threats experienced by Les Stroud in his 30+ year career of wilderness survival. With skill, creativity, and a little help from Les, you may just make it out alive!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/survivorman-vr-the-descent", "videos": [{"id": 92021, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xYe_C6M0Nro", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYe_C6M0Nro", "title": "Survivorman VR: The Descent - Official Trailer | Upload VR Showcase 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xYe_C6M0Nro/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 106810, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "s6EYmdJoCcY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6EYmdJoCcY", "title": "Survivorman VR: The Descent - Reveal Trailer for PS VR2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s6EYmdJoCcY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
