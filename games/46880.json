Don't let them hit as they make the wall weaker. This sounds simplistic and is, but highly addictive as you score points for every alien destroyed. If a segment of the outer wall is destroyed (by the aliens kamikaze into it) if this happens enough times the outer wall flashes and you need to move in a level, post haste. If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive. If you stay alive long enough with no more incidents, you can regain that which has been lost...precious wall.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wall-defender", "videos": [{"id": 132053, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ERqIwCzsJwA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERqIwCzsJwA", "title": "Wall-Defender (Atari 2600) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ERqIwCzsJwA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
