Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a \"Skins\" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 31444, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "MBpKpROtUKo"}, {"id": 43193, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h0aeDmq8SLQ"}]}
