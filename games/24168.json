First, you must listen to music represented in the game by concentric rings of sound. Once you pick up the beat, you can dance into the middle of the rings to try to \"catch\" the music. If successful, you'll achieve the power to manipulate the sound rings to create entirely new music. As you progress through each level, you'll be rewarded with new visual displays, power-ups, and bonuses.", "summary": "This is a game where you have to use your sense of rhythm to pass the levels with 85 different songs.\n\nYou walk around on a little stage with your character. As the music plays, markers pop up on the stage that expand in sync with the music. You have to hit those markers at the right time. This will trigger an instrument or jingle of the music (and give you points). Each characters has special abilities - some of them for example can move the markers to get them closer (or out of reach of the opponents). All characters can use a pitch-bend to change the tone of a triggered jingle for extra fun.\n\nApart from having several game modes, you can also play this game solo or with a friend, either cooperative or in a battle mode to see who's got a better sense of rhythm.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/technic-beat", "videos": [{"id": 106002, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IeE2kugBRQw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeE2kugBRQw", "title": "Technic Beat ...
