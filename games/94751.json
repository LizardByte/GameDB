E and CASI must work together to fight dangerous battles, solve fiendish puzzles and unravel the nefarious plot behind the mysterious \"Meek\" uprising. Players can switch between E and CASI in single player or they can play in local, two-player co-op where each player controls the reluctant heroes individually on their own device.
