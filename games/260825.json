It is meant for ZDoom-based source ports, and contains nine maps primarily aimed towards cooperative multiplayer, but fully playable in single player as well. Development of DBZone started in 2006, with the release of home.wad by Tails, which later evolved into the first map of the episode, DOOM City. The PWAD furthermore has several changes via DeHackEd and DECORATE: many of the vanilla enemies are made to attack or move faster, and a new weapon and monsters are also included.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-barracks-zone"}
