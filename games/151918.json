Shiragiku is unfazed and cheery and flippant and whimsical and capricious; Shirayuri is nowhere to be found; and Hanashiro? Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then.\n\nHanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know.\n\nHanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran.\n\nAnd they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue.\n\nThey also might be the first to kill an immortal.", "summary": "OCHITSUBAKI || \u843d\u3061\u693f is a bilingual JPN/ENG game about translation and how it can run as deeply as the way hypermarginalized people constantly \"translate\" their identities and traumas for the understanding of others, no matter how far it is from the source material. It is is a visual novel that combines a retro anime aesthetic with distinctly modern elegance, and it has three language options: JPN, ENG, and JPN translation. The ENG/JPN versions are two different renditions of the story, thus requiring a separate JPN translation, emulating what happens when you try to translate something as complex as identity. My biggest inspiration is the Sega Utena game, playing it in both ENG/JPN.\n\nIt contains a linear narrative written in a hybrid poetic verse with an original soundtrack and original graphics. The final build contains the JPN version, the ENG version, and a translation of the JPN adaptation."}
