Hungry wolves have been plaguing the peasants, stealing their chickens at night, and things are about to get worse. Much worse.\n\nAssign peasants to tasks and balance gathering and building defenses with harvesting food and maintaining the village. Every decision is final, every loss is permanent. Every mistake brings you closer to be swallowed by the forest, your people's story forgotten and lost in the sands of time.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
