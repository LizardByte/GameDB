If you use your right mouse button you can launch an avalanche rocket. And for every enemy you send scurrying back, you get bonus points. All the time, the dragon urges you on like an enthusiastic football coach, cracking jokes and celebrating the hits. He is desperate to fend off the \"creepy Huns\". Mushoot is an addictive game which is simple to play and it is likely to appeal to all ages. \n \nIn the second game, Rooftop Ruckus, you join the sharp-tongued monkey Abu and leap across rooftops putting on lights. It's a high-speed chase and you have to watch out for the evil genie who comes running after you. The instructions are clear and the animation is excellent. The characters are very engaging and complain if you leave the game too early. Anyone who enjoyed the movie Aladdin will find this game fun and entertaining. You are awarded extra points for picking up bags of gold or for making guards slip. \n \nBoth games can be played solo or with friends and they will appeal to beginners and experts.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disney-hotshots-arcade-frenzy-mushoot-slash-rooftop-ruckus"}
