The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat.

The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.", "summary": "Sagaia for Game Boy (commonly known as Darius II) is a shoot 'em up video game originally released in 1991 for the Game Boy in Japan only. This game is a original title for the handheld console, mixing elements from the first two games while featuring its own unique levels.\n\nThis game is single player only, not featuring formation bonuses and zone selection at the end of the levels, but the ending is divided into three depending on the difficulty.
