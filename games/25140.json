Your objective is to eat 10 \"foods\" that appear randomly on the field. Each time you gobble a food, your worm gets longer; if you hit anything except the food (like walls or yourself), you use a life. If you've eaten 10 foods, a door opens and you can leave the level, coming to the next level with additional walls. There is also time limit of sorts: if you'll not eat next food in given time range, it will multiply and counter of \"needed food\" will go up.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pacworm"}
