You live the life of a recently summoned skeleton from a decrepit and clearly insane necromancer. His weak ability\u2019s at magic have left him with you as his only chance at entry back into the mages castle from witch he was expelled not for redemption but for revenge. You are left to find your own way through this insane and dangerous world and your own identity therein. Do you serve the will of your dark master or make your own path as something more. The game takes its largest inspiration from classic RPGs games such as Dark Souls and Diablo 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
