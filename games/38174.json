As with the original, Ganba League '93 has a cartoony presentation and emphasizes arcade-style fast gameplay over more serious sim elements. All the included teams are fictional and the player can even edit their own teams. The player can choose between playing a one-off game or entering a pennant race, as well as selecting one or two human players or letting the CPU play against itself with the Watch mode.\n\nThe game is the second in this series, with a third game Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu '94 Ganba League 3 released the following year. Only the first game in the series, Extra Innings, ever left Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hakunetsu-pro-yakyuu-ganba-league-93", "collections": [{"id": 3634, "name": "Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League"}]}
