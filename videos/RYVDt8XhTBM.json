With a fiery blast from your Hellfire missiles you must annihilate a ruthless tyrant's military arsenal. Smoke his private yacht and tear into his air force as you challenge the Madman's forces in a series of surgical strikes. Rip through 27 fiery missions. Force is highly recommended.\"\n\nThe First in the Strike series. The original Desert Strike - Return to the Gulf on Sega Mega Drive / Genesis. All the strike games are fondly remembered and the franchise should be brought back. It was ported to pretty much all the consoles out at the time, including Master system which looks great everything considered. The Ultimate version however fell on the Amiga. With its extra gfx and sounds it makes this version a bit bland and lacks a bit of immersion.\n \nI'm not sure if its an emulation issue, but the Engine sound is way to low and the chaingun hit sound is unbearable so make sure your volume isn't too high ;) Its not a very optimal playthrough. There are Objectives I didn't need to do (like capturing all commanders instead of needed 1) and in campaign 3, I was carrying the two news reporters for most of the mission which slowed mission progression.\n\n00:00:00 Intro + Campaign 1 Air Superiority\n00:22:44 Campaign 2 Scud Buster\n00:56:05 Campaign 3 Embassy City\n01:31:39 Campaign 4 Nuclear Storm", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYVDt8XhTBM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYVDt8XhTBM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYVDt8XhTBM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYVDt8XhTBM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [167] Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf", "description": "Http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nDesert Strike, developed by Mike Posehn of Granite Bay Software and published by Electronic Arts in 1992.\n\n\"The Scuds Are Back!!!
