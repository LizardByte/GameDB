In order to find the dolphin, Barbie must find 3 musicians in the area so that she can ask them to play at her party; and she must solve 2 minigames in each area. Each area has a maze game where Barbie must collect an accessory that she will be able to wear at the party (necklace, crown, and earrings). Other minigames include a Breakout clone, a matching game, and a puzzle game in which Barbie must rock all of the baby cuddlefish to sleep while not waking others who are already sleeping. \n\nAdditionally, the game includes activities to decorate the collected accessories as well as the party stage.
