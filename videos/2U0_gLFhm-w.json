Widescreen hacked through a Hex code method.

It's made in full 3D, there are no pre-rendered backgrounds like in Resident Evil series, Galerians etc. It features some interesting mechanics regarding combat. There is an aiming sensor, showing where will the shot hit the enemy, you can this way land headshots fairly easily. Also you can control how high you aim your weapon, a sort of 360 type of aiming horizontally, left and right, and also in a very limited way up and down. You can aim for the head, legs etc. It sounds pretty good compared to say Resident Evils, but in reality it is unstable, undependable, massive source of anger and rage for me during this playthrough.\n\nAlso once you finish the game, you can access the playthrough with the second character. \n\nWhat do I think of the game? Same as of every RE clone and Resident Evil games. Wanky, barely controllable, cheesy, comically laughable sometimes (\"COLONEL COLONEL COLONEL\"), not that beautiful or advanced technologically. This one features unlocked framerate, which varied from 25 to 50, emulator was accurate enough to show the flactuations. Boss fights are bad, as they are basically all one-trick ponies, which in theory sounds easy, but due to horribly bad tank controls and the aiming system, it's near impossible to do exactly what you wanted to. Typical RE Clone. 7/10.\n\n\nThe background to Carrier involves some reading into as the current events in the game are influenced by past organizations that are pivotal to the storyline. Following the year 2008, the world faced an economical decline as natural resources and agriculture had reached a new low. A massive political divide ensued as the leaders of advanced nations decided to restrict the transportation of aid and agricultural items to their respective countries: those on the Southern Hemisphere and those on the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nNaturally this caused a massive decrease in trade and employment for both sides that sparked great economic and moral criticism from the G77, a political organization formed by seventy-seven different southern countries.\n\nAs conditions worsened for the southern countries, terrorist activity arose from the south, so much that the terrorist leaders formed a large group known as the Southern Cross. Southern Cross activity in Colombia caught the concern of the US military, so much that the US took a militaristic stand against terrorist activity and started the US-G77 Crisis, though the G77 claimed to have been uninvolved in the Southern Cross activities. Despite this, the leaders of the northern countries organized an international enforcement known as the NTA (Northern Treaty Alliance) to assist the north's military strength against terrorist activity. The US military added to this by constructing larger bases and vehicles against the Southern Cross, including a base in Mozambique and an enormous and technologically advanced aircraft carrier named Heimdal.\n\nWith the Heimdal as the US Navy's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ever constructed and capable of launching a barrage of ballistic missiles, the carrier soon demonstrated its power on a mission called Operation Hurricane. Three Special Forces divisions were placed on the Heimdal to carry out an attack on a Southern Cross base as well as to pick up an ancient organism said to have been located somewhere in the South Pacific. The next day after the transportation of the organism, sabotage struck the engine room, though the Heimdal could still make its course back to American shores. Two days afterward, the Heimdal exhibited a period of radio silence, yet the ship was still heading for shore through the Pacific.\n\nIt's here that an NTA investigation team known as SPARC is sent to enter the Heimdal and discover what caused the radio silence. The first team that was originally sent in landed and entered the ship safely, but were quickly silenced; a second team was sent in afterwards, hopefully to assist the previous team. When the team's helicopter starts to land on the Heimdal, the Heimdal's guns automatically lock-on to the chopper and shoot it down, separating the team aboard the Heimdal. It's from here that very odd but dangerous mutants attack the main characters in their search for the truth.\n\n#survivalhorrorgaming  #horrorstories #horrorstory  #residentevil #carrier #dreamcast", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U0_gLFhm-w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U0_gLFhm-w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U0_gLFhm-w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U0_gLFhm-w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Carrier | Survival Horror | Dreamcast | 4K50 PAL Widescreen | Longplay Full Game Walkthrough", "description": "Full game longplay of Carrier, a Sega Dreamcast exclusive, survival horror RE clone, developed and published by Jaleco, released in January/February 2000, PAL version of the game played here.
