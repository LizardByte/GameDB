A great King, mighty and fair, ruled the land of Xen with responsibility entrusted to him by the gods before they left the mortal plane. With this trust came the Solstice Sphere, an ancient and mysterious artifact possessing great power. In time the king married and the union yielded twin daughters, Adeline and Marian. They were like the sun and the moon, opposites but forever entwined with the future of Xen.\n\nTime passed and the princesses grew, reaching womanhood before the eyes of their people. Adeline became a shining beauty, like the sun with a heart of gold. The people of Xen adored her. Always at her father's side, she watched and learned as the King went about his duties. With a thirst for knowledge, she learned from the greatest teachers in the land. It was her destiny to one day inherit the throne and become the kingdom's future.\n\nWhile Adeline became like the sun, Marian grew to become the moon. In the shadow of her sister she became envious, and the darkness of jealousy soaked her heart. While admirers heaped endless praise on Adeline, seeds of bitterness and resentment began to grow in Marian. Hidden under the sheen of superficial happiness, they waited for the perfect moment to bloom.\n\nYears passed, and the princesses approached the age of 18. On their birthday Adeline received a special gift from her parents\u2014the Solstice Sphere! On that day the mysterious ancient relic passed from father to daughter. But it was far from a glorious occasion. A series of horrific events would soon take place and ultimately drench the land of Xen in the suffering it knows today.", "summary": "Secret of the Solstice is a Korean MMORPG developed by DNC Entertainment. Players pick a class, fight monsters, and complete quests to level up in a world of cute 2D sprites.\n\nUS Secret of the Solstice was subsequently shut down by its publisher 'Outspark' for 'undisclosed reasons'. Any and all time and real money that players put into the game was lost. However Outspark offered a character merge to 'Solstice Reborn' a beta of a new release of Solstice. On October 24, 2011, the Beta was released for 1 week until it closed and Outspark removed all traces of its existence. Outspark also shut down their forums for comments on 'Solstice'.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/secret-of-the-solstice", "videos": [{"id": 120323, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aFk8Az9kGd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFk8Az9kGd8", "title": "Secret of the Solstice Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aFk8Az9kGd8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
