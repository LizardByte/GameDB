Step into the most visually stunning voxel universe, custom-crafted for the unparalleled immersion of VR. Explore a massive world, gather resources, naturally craft with your hands in 3D, and build anything you can imagine!\n\nChoose Your Own Path: Allow your creativity and imagination to run free, or follow the objectives that guide you through the progression of the game, starting from breaking off your first piece of wood from a tree to collecting increasingly rare resources and crafting powerful tools that allow you to fully shape your world.\n\nInfinite possibilities: Navigate intricate, luminous caves delving deep underground, smelt collected resources with realistic VR furnace mechanics, explore deserts to find yourself a cute gecko friend, or design a fortress on top of a towering mountain where you get an amazing view over the world. Construct a bridge to connect two sky-high floating islands, dig yourself deep into the ground and work on complex underground structures, or forgo all that and focus on becoming more and more powerful and having ever more options to leave your mark on the world.\n\nSeize the Dynamic World: In cyubeVR, if you can see it, you can reach it \u2014 or even destroy it. Explore a fully destructible world that's as fluid as it is expansive, made up of hundreds of billions of individually modifiable voxel blocks, with smoothly changing time of day and weather. Experience the beauty of snow flakes slowly accumulating and turning a once sunny field into a winter wonderland.\n\nStunning Visuals: Immerse yourself in a world brought to life by complex dynamic lighting and captivating night skies adorned with beautiful auroras. Experience unparalleled clarity and detail up close - thanks to meticulously crafted 8K textures and eye-tracked foveated rendering powered by Unreal Engine, even the closest inspection reveals a world in stunning sharpness.\n\nMod Support on PS5: Easily browse, download and install custom mod blocks created by the cyubeVR community for maximum variety in your builds.
