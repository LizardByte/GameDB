Ninja-kun can also acquire scrolls that briefly give him stronger attacks, like a fire burst that takes out all nearby enemies.\n\nEach stage (or \"scene\") has a different layout, with some being merely a single screen (such as Scene 1) as well as larger vertically- and horizontally-scrolling stages. The enemies are usually different too, with increasing difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
