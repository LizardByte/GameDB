Neco Drop 2 is a sequel to the 2020 April Fool's game Neco Drop: Cat Friends Nation. The Game is a tie-in to Street Fighter V and was hosted on the Street Fighter V homepage. All Characters in the game are cats based on Street Fighter V characters. \n \nThe gameplay is very similar to Bejewelled or other versions of \"SameGame\". You get a set number of blocks to remove, you then click one of the tiles and all the connected tiles of the same colour disappear. If you clear the specified amount of tiles within the turn limit, you win. If you lose you can bet on a pre-recorded Street Fighter V match to win more turns.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neco-drop-2", "videos": [{"id": 47405, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ulFUMCrDBiQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulFUMCrDBiQ", "title": "Neco Drop 2 [Video Game Sample]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ulFUMCrDBiQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
