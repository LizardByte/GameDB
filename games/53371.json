No commodity is more enticing to Smugglers than Mordheim's Wyrdstone. Smugglers must be skilled with swords and pistols, accustomed to fighting against many foes, and not averse to tricks and traps. Most of all, they must be charismatic, able to rally their comrades in their darkest hour.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mordheim-city-of-the-damned-the-smuggler", "videos": [{"id": 84569, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FrTi5hqADho"}]}
