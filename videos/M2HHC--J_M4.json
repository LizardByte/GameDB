Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play.\n\nAre you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? \n\nA PSYCHEDELIC SCI-FI JOURNEY \nULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami.
