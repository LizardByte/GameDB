Unlike its predecessor, it was released on the Neo-Geo Pocket Color system, so its graphics were no longer monochrome.\n\nIt was designed as a conversion from the most recent game in the Samurai Shodown series, Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, and almost all of its story events, endings and cutscenes are derived from its arcade cousin. Almost all of the characters from Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage are included (the sole exception being Hanma Yagyu). It also re-added two series favorites who were not in the arcade, Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-shodown-2--1"}
