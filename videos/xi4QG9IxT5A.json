He wished the help of Alpha Squadron to destroy the rebels without involving the local militia. He instructed the lieutenant not to arrest any of the rebels.\n\nThe Alpha Squadron forces fended off the Sons of Korhal, but shortly afterwards they made hostile contact with xenomorphs. Collins demanded their immediate destruction, \"whatever they are\". This minor attack was repelled by the Confederates. Immediately after the encounter with the xenomorphs, an obscure group identifying itself as the Cerberus Recon Squad appeared. They were using advanced technology and claimed they were under orders to oversee the extermination of the xenomorphs and prevent their spread to other colonies. The Cerberus unit dispatched to the scene consisted of two Cerberus Goliaths and four Cerberus Firebats.\n\nCerberus Commander was very disrespectful of Magistrate Collins. Nonetheless, his forces assisted in the destruction of the local Sons of Korhal base.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJourney to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and take command of an elite team of Confederate Marines in the Precursor Campaign. Whether you're new to real-time strategy games or a skilled veteran, you'll be faced by the challenge of leading your troops to victory over powerful and truly alien opponents. Can you restore peace to the fringe-world of Chau Sara?\n- 5 all-new missions that foreshadow the upcoming galactic war.\n- Tutorial mission to introduce new players to the ways of war.\n\nThe StarCraft: Precursor campaign is a series of single-player mission which take place approximately a month before StarCraft Episode I and depicts much of the Battle of Chau Sara.
