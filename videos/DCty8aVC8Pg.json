It's all in the timing, and unfortunately quick reflex as some of the shots give you little chance to prepare.  You can aim your gun higher or lower, but seems best to just have it set at a decent angle and worry about timing the shots.  This game was odd for me - sped up & slowed down... but I got 2 extended plays, and so scored fairly well.  Still... once was enough for me!   15,350 - crazy game? Lucky?
