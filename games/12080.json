He underestimates you.\n\nForce their hand as you lead your people past the dangers waiting on Valhalla Hills and fight to prove your honor, your strength, your worthiness. Look after your Vikings, gathering food, chopping wood, and mastering the complex economics of wilderness survival. \nReach the portal at the top of each mountain, and shout your battle cry loud enough for the gods to hear. \n\nIf they will not give your people the reward you all deserve, then by your axe, you will take it from them.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valhalla-hills", "videos": [{"id": 8172, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "T_tlQVYZrNM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_tlQVYZrNM", "title": "Valhalla Hills Gameplay Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_tlQVYZrNM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8171, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tZDMFwrBYpc"}]}
