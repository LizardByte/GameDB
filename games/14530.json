Playing as a bomberman, the player can lay bombs to destroy all of the monsters, which will subsequently open the gate. Destroying blocks in the maze may uncover useful items including remote control bombs, accelerators, and hearts. There are five levels total and at the end of each is a boss. Each boss is faced first alone in an arena. When defeated, the boss retreats to another arena where the player will face him in a personalized machine. After the boss is defeated, the player will continue to the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bomberman-2", "videos": [{"id": 63019, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EIDyyO8HP_k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDyyO8HP_k", "title": "Super Bomberman 2 (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIDyyO8HP_k/sddefault.jpg"}]}
