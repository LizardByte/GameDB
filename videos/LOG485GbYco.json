PS2!Arcana Heart looked WAY better. There's NOTHING \"SUGGOI!\" about this game.\n \nPlaying Story mode with Saki \"SOMERSAULT JUSTICE!!\" Tsuzura on default (4) difficulty. I lose a few rounds (L.G.A. Dodge makes me rage, Angelia was being tough, and Angelia+Mildred = SNK!). Don't expect any Arcana Blaze (seriously, Thunder's is full of fail) and Saki's Critical Heart is friggin' Geese Howard Deadly Rave, but more complicated!! I also attempt to fight Parace L'Sia (SNK on drugs!!), but I gave up after close to an hour of trying to beat her (I got REALLY close on two matches). Parace L'Sia can be fought by going through Story Mode without losing a SINGLE ROUND (including Angelia+Mildred fight). It comes after said Angelia+Mildred fight The ending is still the same though. I had to use cheat code to get to her, only because of the Angelia+Mildred fight. I tried normally with one round wins, but it is just that damn fight. I show the scene after defeating Parace L'Sia.\n\nVideo is at ~30 FPS because deinterlacing for ~60 FPS = BAD BOBBING! Any oddities may be from playing from a HDD. Flickering may be due to encoding or TDeint.
