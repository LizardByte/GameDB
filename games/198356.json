It is set during nuclear winter, and features 35 new maps and a totally replaced roster of weapons and enemies in the style of an early-90s 3D shooter. Impie made the mod as a promotional gimmick for a dystopian novel series set in the same universe. The gameplay involves lots of fast, brutal shootouts with enemies that die relatively easily, but can badly injure the careless player. Each episode features a short story that sets the stage for the action to follow, written in the novel's pulpy style.\n\nThe mod series is referred to as \"Winter Agent Juno.\" Impie got the mod series title from a Japanese review blog's description of the mod: \"Winter Agent Jin: Destroy the Armored Sisters Institute!\".\n\nImpie later released a fan mod of the Wolfendoom episode Operation: Arctic Wolf using Project Einherjar assets.\n\nAn 11-map sequel episode, Midgard Outlaw, was released in 2018. The third Winter Agent Juno mod, Operation Sea Wolf, was released in 2019.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-einherjar"}
