Melbourne-based tech company Neuras decides to attempt the impossible: installing AI drives into the freshly dead to create a cheap and endless supply of workers.\n\nAfter a year of disappointing results, the Neuras lab suddenly cuts all contact with their investors. You, a contractor for the country's largest investment firm, have been tasked with investigating the lab and recovering the firm's rightful IP. But it's the firm's other investment project -- a sonar-based image recognition visor -- that might end up being your bigger problem.\n\nThat, and the footsteps you keep hearing behind the door.", "summary": "Proximate is a dread-driven narrative game inspired by Iron Lung and anatomy. Investigate a deep sea laboratory and piece together the events that lead to the research team\u2019s demise.\n\nDue to the security concerns of your mission, you will be required to wear a sonar-based visor that only tells you the bare minimum information you need to succeed \u2014 and sometimes less.
