The player takes on the role of a rookie pilot in a band of \"sewer jockeys\", whose job is to exterminate dangerous mutated creatures to keep a vast network of sewers clean for \"Solar City\", an island paradise from which the evil Commissioner Stenchler (Robert Costanzo) gives his orders and critiques. The player's copilot, Ghost (David Underwood), evaluates the player's performance throughout the game, while a small robot named Catfish (voiced by Robert Weaver) scouts ahead and gives directions. The player is later assisted by Falco (Kari G. Peyton), a female jockey who believes that there is a hidden route to the surface. Falco is later captured by Stenchler, who threatens to mutate her into one of his mindless minions. This plot is thwarted when Ghost and the player reach Solar City.", "summary": "Sewer Shark is an FMV-based shooter, and one of the first games released for the Sega CD. You move a crosshair around the screen and shoot targets. Occasionally, you can also choose to change directions at fixed points.\n\nOf course the real attraction in a game like this is the story. In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels. Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as \"ratigators.\" You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators. It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sewer-shark", "videos": [{"id": 36134, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "DlDboN4dIo0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlDboN4dIo0", "title": "Whip Ass Gaming: Sewer Shark Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlDboN4dIo0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
