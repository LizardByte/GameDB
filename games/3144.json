Trade syndicates have sprung up to exploit the post-war confusion for their own ends and the players' party will wade into this uncertain environment. In order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through Faerun by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. As they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new\nfaction working behind the scenes: the evil, shape-shifting, serpentine Yuan-Ti.\n\nIn addition to trading and economic manipulation, the Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map allows players to explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the\nNeverwinter Nights games. Exploration will take players from well-known locations, like Neverwinter and Crossroad Keep, to more exotic areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of Samarach. Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become.\n\nThe 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neverwinter-nights-2-storm-of-zehir", "videos": [{"id": 1702, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1SFePqAp314", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SFePqAp314", "title": "Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1SFePqAp314/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
