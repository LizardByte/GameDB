Though, no matter his choice, a sinister voice in his head may have other plans.\n\nPARKSIDE is a First Person Shooter / Immersive Simulation, with a focus on freedom, choice, and consequences.\nSet in the fictitious city of Abbotsford, California in the year 2038, the world the player experiences is the result of four years of shrouded meddling by the Illuminated Brethren - the environment is cold and unforgiving, the people are drab and demoralized, narcotics and gangs are rife, and military police walk the streets. How has it come to this?\n\nFollowing his capture by the Brethren, Alexander is interfaced with an experimental combat platform known as POLYPHEMUS. Through a piece of technology called the Remote Combatant Viewer, he is sent to complete illicit, dangerous missions for the Brethren, whose directives come from the mysterious Divine Rod.\n\nMany tools are at the player's disposal to tackle problems including a roster of futuristic weapons, armaments such as EMP grenades and frag mines, and abilities that can be used to navigate all manner of obstacles. You can hack or bypass keypads, security cameras, turrets, and robots... or shoot them to bits - pick your poison and run with it as you navigate smoky streets, dark alleys, airy vents, and secret bases. Keep in mind that you're not the only one with a gun...\n\nChoices matter - in the secret fight for control of the precious lives of all citizens, there are many powerful stakeholders.
