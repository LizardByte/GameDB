The car can fire a missile upwards diagonally and release a flare bomb into the air which falls in a downward arc. the game takes place across 4 levels, each loosely based on a particular Bond movie and with a particular objective to complete before proceeding to the next level. To reach each objective, the player needs to avoid crashing in to obstacles or enemies and avoid being hit by enemy fire. \n\nEach level based on a James Bond movie as follows: \n\nLevel 1: Diamonds Are Forever - Across desert and sea at night, avoid the laser beam from the satellite and the craters it creates; armed frogmen, submarines and mines to land on the oil rig. Shoot the orbiting diamonds to light the way and reveal the oil rig against the night sky. \n\nLevel 2: The Spy Who Loved Me - A sea-based mission. Avoid missiles launched from the sea bed, helicopters, mines and ships. Bomb Stromberg's undersea laboratory and rescue the escape pod that carries agent Anya Amasova. \n\nLevel 3: Moonraker - Avoid Moonraker space shuttle launches, armed frogmen, submarines and mines. To complete the mission, destroy 3 poison globes launched from space. \n\nLevel 4: For Your Eyes Only - Across darkened waters off the Greek mainland, launch flare bombs to light up the sea and make your enemies visible. Avoid frogmen, submarines, mines and jellyfish in the dark depths of the sea and armed helicopters from above. Complete your mission by diving down to the sunken fishing trawler to retrieve the top secret missile launching radio equipment. \n\nAt the end of the game, you are awarded an agent rating.
