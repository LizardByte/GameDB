Travel through 80 screens of spikes, traps, and pooping birds to save her.\n\nGameplay is inspired by the game Bubble Ghost, an old favourite of mine and although fans of Bubble ghost will see that gameplay is very different at the same time there is not much else to compare Ballonys adventure to.\nLeft click anywhere on the screen and Balloony will turn to face that direction, then Right click and he will fly off in the selected direction bouncing off of walls and generally being hard to control. Watch out for spikes, lava and other miscellaneous traps as you bounce your way through eighty screens of balloon popping mayhem.", "videos": [{"id": 65410, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j1XNHQVxCUM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1XNHQVxCUM", "title": "Balloony's Adventure", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1XNHQVxCUM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
