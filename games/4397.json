Each side has multiple units, which can move depending upon the terrain. Conflicts between units are shown as animated sequences, and the player can determine formations, as well as issue and change orders to different troops at any time. Battles between enemy commanders take the form of a side-scrolling 1-on-1 action sword battle.\n\nThere are two scenarios available. The first casts the player as Takauji Ashikaga as he attempts to oust Godaigo and establish a new government, while the second follows Masashige Kusunoki and Yoshisada Nitta, who must try to protect Emperor Godaigo and his imperial rule. The two scenarios intertwine at various points, and graphical story sequences between each battle drive the story.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
