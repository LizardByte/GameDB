Some claim to see figures and hear unusual sounds in the late hours of the night when nobody is expected to be there. This intrigued a small friend group, leading them to sneak into the building and investigate.\n\nAlas, they might have found what they were looking for.\n\nYou play as Harriet, a junior student at the high school. Through her, you will discover the horrific events that unfolded in the local community. The game is intended for players to go into mostly blind, so most of the plot details will have to be discovered on your own.", "summary": "A remake of the game Turtle Head (Originially by Pikasprey) created by Team Meatpie.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turtle-head-unmasked"}
