You are Takt, a young conductor attempting to recruit the best musicians around so that they can put on a concert to save the performance hall. In order to accomplish this, Takt must travel around the city making people happy with his music and recruiting them for his orchestra. Once he has his ensemble together, it's time for the big show: a musical extravaganza at the symphony hall. Perform perfectly and you will save the hall and keep music alive for generations to come. If you fail, the hall will be closed down. The game features 11 levels, including the epic performance at the symphony hall. Touch-sensitive controls allow you to feel the music. The soundtrack features Brahms, Strauss, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Schubert, Beethoven, and many other classical artists.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mad-maestro--1", "collections": [{"id": 11012, "name": "Bravo Music"}]}
