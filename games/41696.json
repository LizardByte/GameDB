It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as \nPopolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The \nsequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite. Now you play as both \nPopolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped \nby a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG. \nYou have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same \ntime there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items \nto complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge \nand sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
