The only addition are the updated team rosters.\n\nSWOS is a top down football/management game, with either quick game or 20-year career player-manager options. The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics.\n\nAnd you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.\n\nWhile the Linux/Macintosh/Windows are just the emulated DOS version, the Xbox 360 has some genuine changes: online multiplayer, updated graphics (the graphical style and the top-down perspective are kept) and dynamic advertisements. The team rosters are still based on season 1996/1997, but the names are not authentic anymore.\n\nIt title is also the base for the remake on Xbox Live Arcade in 2007.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-world-of-soccer-96-slash-97", "videos": [{"id": 54051, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CLGAv24INKs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLGAv24INKs", "title": "Sensible World of Soccer 96/97 Longplay - Amiga - Season 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CLGAv24INKs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
