But there is a house nearby her own that is known for containing some source of creativity: as it is the only part of the town with color. She is told to never enter.\nOne day, however, she does, and enters the world of another fourth-grader named Toby, who also lives in a world bereft of creativity. He is the only one who can see her, which makes him appear insane, if his aberrational personality and appearance weren't enough. After a certain amount of time, however, she disappears back to her own world, leaving him alone until she enters the house again. As a part of his mind, she witnesses the climbs and downfalls of his subconscious.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/white-sky"}
