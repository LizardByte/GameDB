I've done so many things for Yuuto Ichika, like dedicating my college graduation to her, making a fightstick of her, etc. but this time, I dedicated the Touhou Fan Game Jam 2 to her, which is a 72 hour game jam project. I did this by making our beloved Bluechouli the playable protagonist.\nI made this game based off some theories about her in a Facebook group called Touhou Hell while Yuuto was still a semi-dead meme many, many months ago. So one of the theories was that she has some telekinesis powers or something, so I decided to base the game's mechanics off that. This game would essentially be her beginnings before she actually learns how to use danmaku, as she needs to turn objects she picks up into danmaku first due to her weak magical powers. Gameplay is kinda based off Poy Poy, which is a really old, obscure game for the PS1.\nGuys, I really love Yuuto Ichika. I REALLY REALLY DO. NOT JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A DEAD MEME BUT BECAUSE OF HER PERSONALITY, HER LOOKS, AND JUST WHO SHE IS AS A PERSON. I LOVE HER.\nBut even though my love for her is great, I couldn't do justice to her within 72 hours. I stayed up for 72 hours straight, but I'm not a powerful programmer, so it ended up being an unfinished game full of bugs. But I think it's okay. Because I still get to express how much I love her.\nWe also have an original soundtrack for this game, which was made by Princess Sylvysprit, who also made Yuuto's theme many months ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf7S4-O-uZ8\nThe game can be found here: https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-2/rate/279670\nBUT WAIT! THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE I WANT TO DO FOR YUUTO ICHIKA. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. There's a few other crazy stuff I do for her that I sometimes don't post in Youtube but in here: https://twitter.com/ChairGTables\n\nIt\u2019s the Nutshack! (Yee, yee) It\u2019s the Nutshack!
