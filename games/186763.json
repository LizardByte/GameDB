Become an elite LEAP mercenary as you soar into battle.

Whatever your play style, every LEAP mercenary is equipped with a Personal Vehicle (PV), allowing you to quickly cover distances and close the gap on your enemy.\n\nEvery exosuit comes equipped with match altering abilities - Call in an Orbital Laser to wipe out a group of enemies, or throw down a Support Shield to take temporary cover from enemy fire.\n\nEvery obstacle is an opportunity to soar, dash or charge, and an elite mercenary will use their unique movement abilities to navigate the battlefield quickly. Use your grappling hook to reach greater heights or your directional dash to dodge enemy fire.\n\nThe glory of victory only gets sweeter with rewards. Customize your mercenary with helmet emojis and distinct skin options for exosuits, vehicles and weapons. Flaunt and taunt your frenemies with style and sass.", "summary": "Leap is a fast-paced, multiplayer first-person shooter featuring epic battles with up to 60 players, each armed to the teeth.
