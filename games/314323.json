The 2 Games in 1: Sonic Advance & Sonic Pinball Party compilation contains a separate Tiny Chao Garden for each game.\n\nLike the Chao Adventure mini-game on consoles, Tiny Chao Garden allows the player to take their Chao with them and raise it on their Game Boy Advance. The Chao does not age like it does in Sonic Adventure, so the player has plenty of time to raise all of its stats to level 99.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiny-chao-garden"}
