You have to choose from several boards. Your movement is decided when you roll the dice. Certain squares trigger certain events, most being random battles. Your quest depends on which board you choose. There are four player characters, each with different statistics, like attack and magic. Battles are fought by rolling dice, and whoever gets the higher number gets to attack. Damage dealt depends on the stats of both characters and some other factors. You must complete all the boards to face the final boss.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sugoro-quest-dice-no-senshi-tachi--1"}
