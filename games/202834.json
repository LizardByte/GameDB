You start with the summon items for each of the eight companions. Summon selectively, or summon them all!\n\nYou can move through them. They have a decent but not huge health pool, and If they die, they will take thirty seconds to respawn. They will silently teleport behind you if you leave their line of sight, so they'll always be hanging out around you."}
