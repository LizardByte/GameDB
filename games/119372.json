The game celebrates generations of multi-disciplinary motorsport, focusing on driving that feels great - but with a high skill ceiling that will have players spending hours honing their perfect lap. Starting out is simple but learning the nuances of each car's handling and finding the best racing line through each corner of each track will be a challenge for a long time to come. Not only that, but with the option of fuel usage, tire degradation and racing damage, even a good pit stop strategy could make the difference between hero and zero. Feel the rubber bite into the road as you pass the start/finish line and dive, brakes squealing, into the first corner!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 28010, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VOWyVXPELyc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOWyVXPELyc", "title": "Circuit Superstars | Announcement Trailer - E3 2019 | Square Enix Collective | ESRB", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOWyVXPELyc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 56058, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "0au5GBw5yCs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0au5GBw5yCs", "title": "Circuit Superstars | Release Trailer | Square Enix Collective | English | [ESRB]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0au5GBw5yCs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
