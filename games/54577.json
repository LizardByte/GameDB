Players take on the role of a mercenary hired by the Sahiban race to steal the Mazeli's ultimate weapon, a powerful ship called the 'Blazer'. The game features top-down gameplay where players navigate through enemy-infested space, dodging attacks and returning fire with a basic forward-shooting cannon. With no power-ups available, success relies purely on the player's skill and reflexes. Enemies approach from various directions, and players can also target ground-based installations. The mission's high stakes and limited resources (only five ships to complete the task) create a challenging and intense space combat experience, where every decision counts in the quest to turn the tide of an age-old war.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blazer--1"}
