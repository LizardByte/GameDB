Blue boy\u2019s girlfriend is kidnapped by aliens so he goes through 21 levels to save her and he also fight bosses along the way. I think this game reminds you of Mario because all of the enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. The glide/float move works like Rayman. The white squares are checkpoints that you can activate by touching them. After you die you teleport back to the last checkpoint you touched. Somewhere at the end of each level there is a strange moving circle that let you complete the level. This is my second game made with Game Maker Studio.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpfPrc9BDlg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpfPrc9BDlg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpfPrc9BDlg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpfPrc9BDlg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpfPrc9BDlg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Blue Boy Planet", "description": "Play Game Here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/560260/\nDeveloper info: http://www.nannings.nz\n\nSBBP is an 2d platformer with pixel graphics.
