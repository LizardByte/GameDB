The Husk arrive and shatter the Earth into pieces leaving the entire country of The United States drifting as asteroids throughout the solar system. Citizens of the country survive thanks to false atmospheres installed on all regions of the country. Now their only hope lies with the President of the United States equipped with his shoulder cannon and proton sabre to bring all of the asteroids together and become the United Space of America and crush the invading HUSK forces.", "summary": "The United SPACE of America is a high action, arcade style, run-n-gun bullet hell, twin stick shooter that allows you to absorb enemy bullets with your Proton Sabre while you blast through countless enemies and unlock new abilities.
