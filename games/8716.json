It keeps the original shooting gameplay and features all original levels remastered in HD, plus a brand-new level. Updates also included the Postal: Special Delivery add-on levels, and the Tokyo and Osaka levels, which were exclusive of the Japanese release of the original game.\n\nThe game also includes a revolver, along with all the original weapons. The main objective of each level is still killing a certain number of hostile enemies to advance to the next stage. Co-op and deathmatch plays were also added. The game also has an rampage mode, in which the player must score points by killing hostiles and NPCs in a short period using different types of weapons.\n\nEnemies, dialogues, music and sounds were remade, but they are still based on the original game. The game end was also remade and it is different from the first game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/postal-redux", "videos": [{"id": 8175, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "scHKZCCxHEI"}, {"id": 8174, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "W2rxVhKKA9A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2rxVhKKA9A", "title": "POSTAL Redux - Official Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W2rxVhKKA9A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
