Since there isn\u2019t much interaction with its surroundings, the town seems like it is stuck in the past. However, it is because of this exact olden feel and subsequent development that it has turned into a nice hot-springs town for tourists.\n\nOne of the popular sightseeing spots is the legendary katana Murasamemaru, embedded in stone. No one has been able to pull it out\u2026 until Masaomi somehow broke it in half. He has to take responsibility for his actions: \u201cMarriage\u201d with \u2018shrine maiden princess\u2019 Yoshino!? He was perplexed at the unexpected turn of events, but this is only just the beginning. What lies ahead for him is a much more peculiar and mysterious life, including his new fianc\u00e9e, a mysterious girl who only he could touch, and the secret behind the curse that remains on the town.\n\nWhat will become of Masaomi\u2019s love amidst his rapidly changing life? The answer lies within the Murasamemaru in his hands.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/senren-banka", "videos": [{"id": 33162, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "QJrX2zUFr1U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJrX2zUFr1U", "title": "Senren \uff0a Banka - Opening Movie [ENG HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJrX2zUFr1U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
