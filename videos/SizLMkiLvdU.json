You can find the original video here: https://youtu.be/uyZgC0mUGIw\n\nThis version of the trailer features new gameplay footage and shows off the brand-new Level Builder coming in Beta 1.0!\n\nThe original trailer means a lot to us, as we wouldn't be here today if not for the Kickstarter campaign and the media we produced for it.\nIf you pay close attention, you'll even be able to hear that the music has been remastered as well!\n\nThis video will also replace the current trailer on the Steam store page, since it's outdated and only features clips from Forever Fall Forest and Sparklestone Shores.\n\nWe'll announce the Beta 1.0 release date very soon, but we wanna make sure the update is completely finished before we do. This helps us make sure we can ship the update on the day we promise, and that we won't end up delaying it due to unforeseen problems.\n\nStay tuned!\n\nFollow Pattrigue on Twitter for game updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/Pattrigue\n\nJoin our Discord and talk to us:\nhttps://discord.gg/SSUTPCU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SizLMkiLvdU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SizLMkiLvdU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SizLMkiLvdU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SizLMkiLvdU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SizLMkiLvdU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Vibrant Venture: Beta 1.0 Trailer", "description": "Buy/wishlist the game:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1264520/\n\nTo celebrate Vibrant Venture entering the Beta phase soon, we decided to remake the original Kickstarter trailer in 4k!
