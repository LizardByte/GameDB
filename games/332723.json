This mod introduces a metafictional twist, allowing the protagonist (MC) to become self-aware of the game's mechanics and narrative structure, similar to the character Monika in the original game. As the MC gains awareness, players are presented with choices that can lead to multiple endings, including both bittersweet and favorable outcomes. The mod emphasizes the dynamic between the player and the protagonist, offering a unique interactive experience within the DDLC universe.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doki-doki-mcs-revenge"}
