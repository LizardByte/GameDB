While it starts with the player talking to the local King for exposition, similar to other traditional JRPGs, it takes inspiration from different games within the RPG genre. It shares similarities with the first Dragon Quest in appearance, offers the choice of multiple protagonists like in Final Fantasy, features real-time combat without screen transitions like Hydlide or Ys, and adopts the strategy of enemies only moving when the player does, as seen in strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, before facing this final challenge, the player character is tested by the King. They are tasked with entering the dungeon beneath the castle and retrieving important quest items. Once they successfully complete this extensive dungeon, the protagonist is recognized as the Hero of God and can embark on a journey to defeat Baal. This entails exploring the continent to find magical scrolls and eventually acquiring special God-like equipment.\n\nThe term \"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld reserved for honorable souls who died in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elysion"}
