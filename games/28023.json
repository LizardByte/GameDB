Along with the other MoS crew, you\u2019re tasked with exploring Septemius 2, an important exploration vessel that mysteriously veered off-course before it could return to Earth. This is where the game begins, though there\u2019s also a lengthy backstory involving the future of the world (get ready for Neocommunism, folks!), and how governments create killer satellites to keep their opponents in check. This information doesn\u2019t really play into Psy-O-Blade\u2018s main story, but it does remind us that people will always be brutal to each other and that there\u2019s truly nothing new under the sun. The Ministry of Space boasts quite the cast. In addition to Keith, there\u2019s Bob the navigator, a quiet fellow who shares an uncanny resemblance to Robert, the de facto leader of the operation. Mark is a chemical analyst. Michael is an engineer and resident jokester of the group. Doctor Jimmy is old, bald, and unusually quiet. Feminine is a green-haired Data Analyst with an awful name \u2013 surely the English translator didn\u2019t bequeath this moniker upon her, did they? Finally, Sofia\u2019s a computer engineer and Keith\u2019s love interest throughout the game. These characters \u2013 for better and for worse \u2013 are the game. The only way to progress through Psy-O-Blade\u2018s tale of sabotage, murder, and mystery is by engaging with these characters repeatedly.", "summary": "Psy-O-Blade is a 1988 point-and-click adventure game for the MSX, PC-88, and PC-98 by T&E Soft. GRC and Sigma ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990. No version has left Japan.
