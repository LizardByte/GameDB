The story is inspired by Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. It's 1931 and the protagonist (you) is a professor at the Miskatonic University whose colleagues have gone missing on an expedition to the Antarctic. The protagonist not only fears the worst for their colleagues but they also have an inexplicable sense of dread surrounding the expedition. Without support from the university anytime soon, you begin your rogue mission to find out what happened to them. You make your way to Antarctica and find a fishing boat that is willing to drop you off and pick you back up after two days. As you arrive at the shore you discover an abandoned base camp.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/XXzPyCJECu\nWebsite: https://monkeyswithjobs.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dyer Expedition - Teaser Trailer", "description": "Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179390/Dyer_Expedition/\nItch.io: https://retzudo.itch.io/dyer-expedition\n\nDyer Expedition is a puzzle adventure game with light Lovecraftian horror elements.
