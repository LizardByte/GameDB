A lot has happened in the past twenty years while we have been living here. Everyone has a part in the life of the village. We have become a real community. Now that I have grown up it's time for me to decide what part I will play.\n\nPeople say that the woods protect us from the filthy world that Balrum has become. They forget that the place we live in once was a place of horrors. The dark history of the forest keeps trouble outside. The stories about why we had to hide in the woods each seem different. I don't know who to believe. Every time I ask Grandpa about the past he changes the subject. One thing is for sure. Something horrible happened. Maybe one day I will know the truth.\n\nI know that Grandpa was a mage when he was younger but he rarely uses magic nowadays. He often tells me that I should practice magic and embrace my supposed abilities, but I\u2019m not sure that I want to. I have been taking lessons in alchemy and the arcane from Brown and Leonard. Life was much easier when I was younger. Now my head is filled with questions and doubts.\n\nIt's raining heavily tonight as we walk back from the hunt with Fox. I have a strange feeling and I can see that Fox is worried too. We separate at the edge of the forest. As I approach our home I smell smoke and can see light shining through the woods. Something bad has happened...\n\nThank you to all our backers on Kickstarter for making this game possible.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ghfEYjaMWM4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ghfEYjaMWM4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ghfEYjaMWM4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ghfEYjaMWM4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ghfEYjaMWM4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Balrum Trailer, Coming February, 2016", "description": "Official Launch on  February 2016\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/424250/\n\nhttp://balconyteam.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/balrum.rpg\n\n\nI was only a child when we fled Erdal and took refuge in Darkwood.
