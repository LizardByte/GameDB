Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTERS HISTORY DYNAMITE!\n\nFighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!\nThe story mode is a gag-adventure story which stars Mizoguchi. Out on a leisurely outing, he takes a break to enjoy his town's specialty: takoyaki (or octopus balls). Before he can place an order, he is confronted by a mysterious man who challenges him to prove the snack's worth against the whole world. After the man disappears in a flash of light, Mizoguchi is somehow provoked enough to search the globe's octopus dishes and to prove that Osaka has the best takoyaki in the world. He does this by awkwardly interrogating the series's characters although he usually misinterprets their explanations as insults or puns.", "summary": "Fighter's History Dynamite was ported to the Sega Saturn in Japan in 1997.
