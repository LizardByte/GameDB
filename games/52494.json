Bush, Osama bin Laden or Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies. Every time the player or the AI makes a move the character walks over the chess move and, if it beats another figure, shows a little fight animation. For better overview the moves itself are ordered on a classical top-down chess-board which is displayed on the lower right corner. The game features six chess boards, e.g. Saddam Hussein's palace.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chess-vs-the-axis-of-evil"}
