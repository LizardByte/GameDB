Between the warrior\u2019s tales of his youth, the player takes control of Courage, a young boy who takes lessons from his elder's experiences to stop the current threat to their village. The game provides players expansive exploration and in-game interactivity on their quest to defeat the sources of evil, continuously offering a significant challenge to players as they advance through a world of untamed wilderness. Brave is able to transform into various animals, track prey, and battle enemies that stand in his way with bows and arrows, tomahawks and a variety of ancient powers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brave-a-warrior-s-tale", "collections": [{"id": 4985, "name": "Brave"}]}
