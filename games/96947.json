While the world spins round and round all you have to do is just press the space bar when the spinning bar is at the right place to make a circle. At first it\u2019s easy, the bar oscillates with a period of pi seconds (3.14 s^-1), giving you plenty of time to make your first circle.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be easy for long! The difficulty increases every pi seconds: The speed of the bar increases by 3.14% (pi %) each time, until it reaches a frequency of 3.14 Hz (pi Hz). Once it reaches that frequency, the speed of the bar decreases again, until it reaches a period of pi seconds (3.14 s^-1).\n\nIt sounds complicated doesn\u2019t it? If you try it out you\u2019ll see it\u2019s more addictive than complicated.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pi-is-everything"}
