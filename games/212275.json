For a while later, I found myself in the deep wood. The sun already started sinking and it's getting dark in the woods. I was supposed to be on the way back, but I was not. I lost the way back. Eventually, the sun completely sunk and it started to rain in the dark. Then, a light come out of a window in the dark caught my eyes. The light brought me a house. I knocked the door to ask for a night's lodging, but there's no answer from inside. Though, I couldn't stand outside, it was freezing cold, So I decided to break in the house with worries. The atmosphere of the house is retro and nostalgic. A fire was already made in a fireplace. The warmth heated up my cold hands. There's still no answer to my hello, but I rested in the house for a while. It's rude to stay too long in other's place, so now I'm getting out the house.... Wait, what!? I can't open the door!
