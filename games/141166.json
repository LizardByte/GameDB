Collect extra points and pocket millions in the bonus zones. You can\u2019t play this with a standard ball, this one has special skills \u2013 get it up to the maximum speed and score bonuses. Discover new higher levels and when the flood catches up with you and you\u2019re in the water use the jet jump and rise above the water table. Remember, immersion in the water raises the electrical voltage of the ball, so lower it down to 0% at special ports. Are you falling down and see that the water is close? Use the rescue bubble and give yourself a chance, keep playing, break records.\nAre you ready for this challenge?\nThe flood is coming near!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jetpin", "videos": [{"id": 43109, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bZfhf68fHtI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZfhf68fHtI", "title": "jetPIN now available for Nintendo Switch!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZfhf68fHtI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
