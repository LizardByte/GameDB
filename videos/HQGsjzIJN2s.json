This map was designed by Darkwave0000 and what drew me to it was the amazing architecture, I think it's a very good looking map.

I had to get the BFG first because the plasma releases 3 Arch-Viles and my run always ended when I tried to face them without a BFG. The blue key fight is incredibly scary for me because I need to lure enemies away from the Arch-Vile in the corner in order to blast him and then lure them to the other side so I have room to hit the switch and get out.\n\nFor the final fight I lured the hoards of Hell Knights, Imps and Arch-Viles into the room in order to clear a path to the second room where I can begin initiating the giant slaughter fest. Admittedly I took the coward's way out and used an Arch-Vile to launch me back to safety here. From here I triggered a bunch of infighting until there was just about 400 enemies left and then cleaned up the rest with the BFG and some rockets.\n\nThis map took less attempts than any of my other demos, just around 100 attempts, most of which screwed up right at the beginning.
