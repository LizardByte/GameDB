Characters are mostly characters from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Each character has special moves inspired by that character's role in the story.\n\nThere's a special condition where characters are about to die (their health draining away) in which they are much more powerful and have infinite special power: the opponent has to avoid those special attacks until that character dies. This sometimes gives the advantage to players who reach low life first.\n\nThere is also a practice mode, where the player can learn how to perform the special moves of each character.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arm-joe-les-miserables", "videos": [{"id": 81744, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "19ING9kPgEU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ING9kPgEU", "title": "Les Mis\u00e9rables [Arm Joe] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
