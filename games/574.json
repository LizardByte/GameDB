The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.\n\nEat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clich\u00e9s. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eat-lead-the-return-of-matt-hazard", "videos": [{"id": 603, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tLoAsVhDq6c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLoAsVhDq6c", "title": "Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard Xbox 360 Trailer - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tLoAsVhDq6c/sddefault.jpg"}]}
