It features 28 sports divided into eight disciplines: Swimming, jumping, throwing, cycling, running, platform diving, archery and the new skeet shooting (two variants). The handling is similar for all of them: rhythmic motions to keep the athlete moving and quick time events (pressing a button when it gets displayed on the screen) for performing certain actions. The mentioned rhythmic motions depend on the input device the player uses, e.g. at the swimming event the player needs to press two buttons alternately when using a keyboard and rotate the analog sticks when using a gamepad. The player character aims automatically during the skeet shooting, the player himself only has to shoot at the right time."}
