When you begin to share notes a sudden explosion happens and you both rush outside to see the cause of it.\n\nYou discover the Professor panicked and the only Vinemon left for you to use is a Water Typed Vinemon named Scoot.\n\nAfter being given Scoot and after the battle with your Rival and Friend Imakuni. You are given the VineGear to keep track of Quests, Manage your PC, and Check the Map of the Region.\n\nAs you overlook the map you begin to realize this world is strikingly familiar while also feeling completely different from places you visited within games you\u2019ve once streamed.\n\nAs you travel the region you will meet many of the characters you\u2019ve created and encountered while streaming. This includes Iconic Video Game Mascots, Original Characters (donut steel), Celebrities, Memes, Streamers, YouTubers, and many more!\n\nExplore, Battle, and Catch in Vinemon before it\u2019s too late.
