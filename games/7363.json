Meitilia is the god of death, presiding over the destruction of life while Formival is the god of life, presiding over the birth of all life and the creation of everything. Meitilia is said to have blessed two types of people - Blades and Sealers - with special powers. Blades have the unparalleled power to destroy things physically while Sealers have the magical power to destroy souls.\n\nFormival's power on the other hand grants him the ability to revive any dead object. Creatures in the face of death allow their souls to escape from their body; once escaped these souls are controlled by fragments of what is known as Formival's Soul. The souls of the creatures would then manifest into monsters which are more powerful and stronger than before. These creatures are known as the Belzeds, which cannot be killed by normal means - instead requiring the skills of both a Blade and a Sealer to destroy both its body and soul.", "summary": "In Last Rebellion, assume the roles of Nine and Aisha who share a single body in the cursed world of Junovald, a land where two gods govern life and death. Decimate your enemies using an intuitive, turn-based battle system which allows you to target individual body parts, as you protect the world from demons and seek revenge for your father's death.\n\nCombining action and strategy, Last Rebellion adds a twist to battles and field exploration with a character switching function. Players can jump between Nine and Aisha at will -- each possess unique, customizable skill sets, so it is important to assign skills to both characters that suit your play style. Match the two characters well and you will be better prepared for what's lurking in the shadows of Junovald.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-rebellion", "videos": [{"id": 118104, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hRc8lpl86dE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRc8lpl86dE", "title": "LAST REBELLION OFFICIAL TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hRc8lpl86dE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118105, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ht5t-OU1jKA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht5t-OU1jKA", "title": "Last Rebellion ...
