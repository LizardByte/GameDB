As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent.\n\nThe game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns. This means you will issue orders then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield. Then issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battle plan.\n\nFlashpoint Campaigns: Southern Storm is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air-defense and anti-tank systems, helicopters and more. As the Commander, you will need to use available off-map assets like long-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes. You may be faced with the specter of using chemical or nuclear weapons to support your forces on the map and win the day.\n\nThe Manual: if you order a physical copy of the game, you will receive a hardbook manual. This hardcover 300-page full-color handbook leaves no stone unturned in fully documenting every aspect of the game system, from game mechanics to advanced systems and strategies as well as designer notes and helpful appendices.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flashpoint-campaigns-southern-storm", "videos": [{"id": 88764, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "3LUcZfs-_l0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LUcZfs-_l0", "title": "Flashpoint Southern Storm in 2 Minutes", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3LUcZfs-_l0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
