All people are dead and have been dead for a long time. Cities are destroyed and monsters are running wild. Due to the lack of new souls coming into hell, the Devil decides to resurrect one soul to go back to the living world and defend against the monsters for his entertainment. He gives this resurrected soul a house to protect and to live in, along with a weapon, and is tasked with killing monsters and sending their souls to hell. In return, the Devil will reward them with better defenses.", "summary": "Cabin of Souls is a mix between a horde-based rogue-lite and a tower defense game, where the player is one of the towers. The player has the choice of either upgrading their defenses, or upgrading their weapons, leading to very different gameplay depending on the player's upgrading strategy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cabin-of-souls"}
