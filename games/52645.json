Defy the kitsune samurai who stole your clan's sacred acorns. Sneak through beautifully hand-painted landscapes, avoid capture by the guards, and snatch victory (and acorns) from your enemies. The vigilant foxes track your silent steps by scent. Keep ahead of them or use your ninja arsenal to escape. Use smoke bombs, ninja speed, shadow clones, freeze bombs, and flame cloaks to defeat your enemies. Hone your skills with Ninja Missions or train for endurance in Survival mode. Baffle your foes across 15 maps, attain 25 ranks, and conquer 5 difficulty levels. Master the way of Nutjitsu!"}
