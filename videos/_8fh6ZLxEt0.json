The major addition in this version is the Options Menu which contains MANY new options allowing you to tweak the experience of the game to your liking. This includes settings like object spawn difficulties, warp scramble on/off, crazy Mario colors and many other things! The update also contains a huge number of bug fixes, impossible star fixes, and spawn scrambling fixes for a much cleaner experience than any previous version.\n\nBig thanks to Kaze Emanuar for helping to create the UI of the Options Menu, and as always a huge thanks to JoshDuMan and nim for all their help with the randomizer! And of course, thanks to all of our betatesters as well.\n\nSM64 Randomizer is a ROM hack designed to create a new game every time you play. When you select a file, a \"seed\" is created which governs stuff such as the placement of objects in levels, the star requirements on doors and the warps to new levels. These things will stay the same throughout your playthrough. You can also set a specific seed, or pick between many different options that change the experience of your playthrough in the Options Menu.\n\nReport any impossible stars, bugs or suggestions in the SM64 Randomizer Discord server!\n\nWii VC Download (WAD File) -\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/e8tniq73tyks4if/SM64_Randomizer_v1.0_-_Wii_VC.zip/file\n\nMusic: SM64 File Select Remix by GrooveCube -\nhttps://soundcloud.com/groovecubemusic/file-select\n\n\nChangelog (v1.0):\n\n- The Options Menu has been added with many new options to pick from. There are so many options that I cannot describe them all in this changelog, but the \"Options Guide.txt\" file in the download has a comprehensive overview of all of them.\n- The main menu has been revamped to look nicer and have proper credit.\n- Seeds and options selected now save to a file.\n- Seeds of existing files now display next to the file icons.\n- Existing files can have their seeds and options overwritten by selecting the seed/option before choosing the file.\n- The printing of seeds on menus has been revamped to be more aesthetically pleasing and easier to read.\n- The Random Seed seed generation has been fixed to be more random.\n- - This removes the need to wait on the file select for a couple seconds to ensure the seed is new.\n- Nonstop mode, which was previously a separate rom, is now integrated into the base randomizer as one of the options.\n- - It is also now possible to complete all main courses in one visit in nonstop mode.\n- Added a couple new seed easter eggs.\n\n\nSPAWNS / OBJECTS\n\n- Fixed many impossible / oob spawns and spawn scrambles.\n- Red coins and singleton coins no longer spawn super high in the air.\n- More objects have been randomized: koopas, underwater shells, BBH cage boo, clams, kelp, fish\n- Many possible yet difficult spawns now only occur when spawn safety is set to Dangerous.\n- - These spawns include Tuxie in WKWW section, spawns in the WDW cage or above the BitFS cage\n- Water level diamonds in WDW no longer randomize to ensure all water levels are reachable.\n- Removed 6th boo in BBH.\n\n\nGENERAL FIXES\n \n- Fixed many crashes, glitches and softlocks.\n- Spawning inside a red coin will no longer render the red coin star uncollectable.\n- Secrets and piranha plants killed will no longer reset between areas.\n- CotMC now has a proper death warp into HMC instead of sharing HMC\u2019s death warp.\n- Treasure chests are easier to activate and no longer spawn a duplicate orange number when opened.\n- Red coin star markers now appear in the three Bowser stages.\n- If Keep Structure is off (default) then the key doors in the castle will resemble ordinary doors.\n- If star door randomization is set to either On or None, the star door opening animation will never play and the 1 and 3 star doors in the castle will resemble ordinary star doors.\n- Randomized star door amounts now should never result in seeds becoming impossible due to impossibly high star requirements.
