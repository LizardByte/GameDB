The player's task is to empty the screen of all the symbols before the time runs out. The symbols have to be arranged next to each other in certain ways - horizontally or vertically. All symbols move at the same time in the indicated direction until they are stopped by another object. The symbols are divided into two groups. The first group is the bricks, which have to disappear. The second group is the heads. The heads can not be removed from the board. They are the moving barrier between bricks, may be an assistance or an obstacle. \nThe game consists of a total of 40 levels."}
