For years, the colorful cast of The Friendly Neighborhood delighted audiences across the globe with their cooky capers and educational adventures. However, as time went on and interest waned, the production studio found themselves out of money and closed their doors for good. Toy sales would dwindle, and birthday balloons and cakes would find new mascots. In time, the once household names would fade into increasingly niche fandoms. Until one night years later, the studio unexpectedly clicks back to life and starts broadcasting The Friendly Neighborhood. TV sets across the globe flicker for a moment before the familiar puppets return for a surprise encore! But this isn't your typical family-friendly holiday special... are those puppets eating each other!?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-friendly-neighborhood", "videos": [{"id": 54999, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "H5D7GoAzytE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5D7GoAzytE", "title": "My Friendly Neighborhood Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H5D7GoAzytE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 91727, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ub3QOdKzBl8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub3QOdKzBl8", "title": "7(ish) minutes of NEW My Friendly Neighborhood Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ub3QOdKzBl8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
