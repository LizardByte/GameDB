The good ending is shown.\n\nGood old Resident Evil has been a horror staple in gaming since the the mid-1990s - it captivated its audiences way back with its amazing graphics, hilarious voice acting, gameplay that walks a tightrope act between adventuring and combat, and one of the scariest, most forbidding atmospheres to ever feature in a game at the time.\n\nEven though just about everyone knows the tale of the Umbrella Corp. at this point - twenty-two years that have since passed since it was first released - and while the technical side of things obviously doesn't compare to anything these days, it still does an admirable job of evoking a sense of dread. Against the understated soundtrack and the constant echoing of footsteps,  you're always keeping an ear out for a telltale moan or scratching sound - the audio does a fantastic job of always keeping you guessing whatever might be around the next corner. The graphics, dated as they may be, are so still very good at ratcheting up the tension - those static camera angles are always positioned in a way to make you feel that something is going to jump out at up you at any moment. \n\nThe puzzle solving is goofy and contrived with its assortment of emblems and crests, and the tank controls are still make it feel like you're driving an 18-wheeler through the mansion, but despite how old fashioned it is, the entire game still has the charm to keep you engaged for hours.\n\nI decided to play the Saturn version because it tends to get ignored in favor of the PS1 game, but really, they're pretty much the same. They each have their pluses and minuses when you compare them directly, but they both represent the best the game had to offer. I actually prefer the character models here (they're texture mapped!) and the Saturn controller feels better suited to the control scheme than the PS1 one does, but really, the differences are pretty minute.\n\nI've never uploaded a playthrough of a Resident Evil game from the main series, so I figured I'd fix that for Halloween this year.\n\nHope you all enjoy it!\n\n/insert jokes about Jill sandwiches and being the master of unlocking here.\n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RODnxEWknWA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RODnxEWknWA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RODnxEWknWA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RODnxEWknWA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Resident Evil (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1997 survival horror game for the Sega Saturn, Resident Evil.\n\nPlayed through as Jill Valentine.
