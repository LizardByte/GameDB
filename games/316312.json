During this event, no matter what your religious convictions, sexual orientation or skin colour: everyone celebrates and everyone loves each other!\n\nEveryone, that is, except me, Sedinho Junior, the football legend. I've won absolutely everything: 9 golden balls, 3 World Cups, 7 Champions Leagues... I'm a multiple billionaire, followed by over a billion followers, loved by everyone, and yet I'm sad.\n\nSad because I know that as soon as the World Cup is over, the party will give place once again to hate. Hate of each other, hate of difference... Sad that we are so divided. Sad to be a simple spectator of our decline.\n\nBut I have decided to change things. If sport can bring people together once in a while, I'm going to give the world more sport than it has never had.\"", "summary": "Mixcity Swap is a fast-paced, competitive mobile card game set in a futuristic sports world, blending strategic deck-building with dynamic real-time gameplay.
