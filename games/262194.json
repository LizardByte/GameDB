Another thing: your relatives are busy on the phone, just like you urgently need to call your buddy. Or you want to chat and play a game of chess, but you can't find anyone to play with. These (and many more) annoying situations are now a thing of the past. Thanks to EyeToy: Chat, a videophone application for the PS2 that lets you talk to friends and other EyeToy: Chat owners while looking them in the eye.\n\nAll you need is a PS2, a network adapter (Ethernet) (for PlayStation(R)2), a broadband connection, an EyeToy (with a built-in microphone) and a copy of EyeToy: Chat. After that, all you have to do is find other Chat users and start chatting.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eyetoy-chat"}
