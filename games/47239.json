You are the hero -- a gallant knight from a noble family and betrothed to the beautiful princess. Your family coat of arms features a large white snake, and because of this you are known as -- the White Viper! \n \nOne day when the princess was out walking you saw her attacked by an evil spirit, sent by a wicked Wizard! In vain you tried to protect her, but the spirit whisked her away, along with your armour. \n \nBut all is not lost, you find a wild horse which you catch and tame. On it you gallop off to the rescue. But the quest is long -- first you must reach the castle of the Wizard, recovering your armour on the way. If you make it that far you will have to encounter the Wizard in person, but if you can defeat him you will be crowned king and take the hand of the princess.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/white-viper"}
