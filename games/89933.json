The object of the game is to cause other players to crash into one of these trails, one of the moving barriers, or the edge of the game area. The first player to win the required number of rounds wins the game, the default winning score is fifteen but this can be altered. \nAn optional feature of this game is the use of missiles which can punch holes in the trails. There are four kinds of missiles available in the game, which the player picks them up by running into them, however each player can only carry one missile at a time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tron--1"}
