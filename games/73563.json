These games are pure interactive movies that display a movie that allows for the player to select among multiple paths at opportune junctures of the storyline. In that way, the game is a \"choose your own adventure\" movie. Unlike other games of the interactive movie genre, which generally display the movie bits using pre-rendered full motion video, this game renders 3D models of the movie in real time.\n\nThe science fiction story of this movie/game follows a group of employees of the interplanetary mining corporation Miller-Western. For a variety of disciplinary reasons, the employees are sent to the Jupiter moon of Ganymede which used to have a thriving osmium-mining operation but is now just a dumping ground for problematic employees who assault their bosses or engineer faulty equipment because they were drunk. No one on the base is to be trusted, everyone is hiding a bevy of secrets and to make matters worse, every monitor across the moon base periodically picks up mysterious transmissions that appear to depict some unknown alien lifeform. Who are they? What do they want? Hence, the subtitle of the game, Alien Discovery.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravity-angels-part-1-alien-discovery"}
