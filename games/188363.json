Inspired by games like Soccer Physics and Dunkers. Responsive, dynamic gameplay with flying bicycle kicks, header deflections, and slide tackles. Featuring a Technos retro inspired art style like NES's Super Dodge Ball in 2.5D.\nPlayers run back and forth for the ball, jumping over each, deflecting the ball with headers, booting it with aerobatic kicks. Dogfighting each other on the ground and in the air, trying to score the next goal past a sport gaming trope invincible AI controlled goalie.\nBuild your team by beating other teams and trading for players with stronger abilities: bigger, run faster, jump kicker, kick harder. Reach the top tiers of Super Jump Soccer playing against national teams from across the world.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-jump-soccer"}
