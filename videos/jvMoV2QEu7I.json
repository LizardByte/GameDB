{"id": "jvMoV2QEu7I", "snippet": {"title": "Mouryou Senki Madara 2 [\u9b4d\u9b4e\u6226\u8a18MADARA2] Game Sample - SNES/SFC", "description": "Being part of the expansive \"Madara Project\", Moryuu Senki Madara 2 is the second of four games based on the popular \"Madara\" manga, novel, and OVA franchise originally written by Otsuka Eiji and with illustrations by Tajima (or Shouu Taji/Sho-U Tajima), developed and published by Konami in 1993. It is also the second (and last) Madara JRPG game developed by Konami, who also developed the original Famicom MSM. MSM2 is unusual from most works within the Madara universe because it features several original characters and an original story, though many characters and villains from the main franchise make appearances.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in both modern Japan and an alternate medieval fantasy Japan and deals with the trials of a 17 year old punk-rocker named Han Kamishiro (by default) and his newspaper editorial staff member girlfriend, Subaru Imose. One day, Kamishiro and Subaru decide to visit an abandoned manor after school around nightfall because it's rumored that great secrets are there but that it's also haunted (if you go home and speak to your mother or say no when Subaru asks to go, the scene loops the following day until you agree to go with Subaru), and it will give Subaru something amazing to add to the school newspaper. When they get there, they find many old texts talking about past events detailing the war of the monsters, the great evil which lead them (Miroku), and the heroes that would lend a hand in fighting the evil (Kirin the \"Master of Majin\" and Madara the \"Apprentice Blacksmith with Legendary Origins Turned Hero\"). Curious, they dig deeper and stumble across a monster which speaks the human language and alludes to the world not being as it seems. They join together to defeat it and find a mysterious pendant similar to one Subaru already has. While leaving through an alternate exit, they see illusions of Kirin and Madara who vanish shortly after introducing themselves and relaying some information about Miroku.\r\n\r\nFascinated by all that they find, the two retire for the day and decide to go to the town's greatest traditional shrine to learn more about the pendant the next day. Kamishiro notices Subaru acting a little odd when he decides to visit the temple as Subaru persuades him to enter the temple unarmed (it's up to you, though the end result is the same). When they enter, a powerful demon who possesses a pendant reveals that he has led you there with a false Subaru (a demon named Kakojien disguised as his girlfriend) and try to kill Kamishiro and obtain all three pendants for themselves. Kamishiro narrowly defeats them (it's programmed so that you shouldn't lose) and with the three pendants in your possession, \"Princess Sakuya\" materializes into your world and warns him about the demon war and Miroku, explains that Kamishiro and Subaru are the modern incarnations of Madara and Kirin, and explains that Subaru has been kidnapped to be used for a dark deed and he may learn of Subaru's whereabouts if he is brave and becomes a hero (yuusha) in the world of Madara. As he accepts, this sets the stage for adventure as Kamishiro is teleported to Madara's world.\r\n\r\nThe game is a bit unconventional from a gameplay standpoint. You acquire spells, buy weapons and armor, travel from town to town gathering info, fight mythological monsters, and occasionally level-grind. However, there are a few key features that make it stand out. For one, you can buy or learn spells within four categories (Shaman / Elemental, Shou Miyou Kei / Superbly Courageous Palm, Rei Jyutsu / Spirit Arts, and Chiryou / Medical Treatment or Cure) from special magicians around the world. Secondly, the game has some non-linear segments to it (its not SaGa-esque, but there are portions which you can tackle in any order). Third, the game has typical stats, but Attack and Defense can reach five digit levels and calculates this ATK/DEF difference between enemies in a complex fashion. Next, you can recruit characters at various junctions. Another thing is you can make the game alert you when characters have low health. Lastly, battles are fought automatically, though you can interrupt to issue commands at any time; characters move across the battlefield and have a movement range like some Lunar games. \r\n\r\nThe cutscenes are exquisite and the overworld graphics and battle graphics are pretty decent for their time. There is good color usage, an emphasis on more realistic character designs and settings, and the characters and enemies animate, including shopkeepers (who react when you make a sale). The gameplay is functional, but the soundtrack is EXCEPTIONAL. Being composed by Tappy and H. Taniguchi who would later work on soundtracks for the Suikoden games, the game features more oriental and tribal music and many orchestrated tunes with piano bits (some tunes really have that Suikoden vibe). It is amongst my favorite obscure VG soundtracks for the SFC.\r\n\r\nWe're working on two introduction vids and a game sample.
