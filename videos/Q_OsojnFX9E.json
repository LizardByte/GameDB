When starting a new company, players get several game modes to choose from: While the Story Mode leads players to success as part of a campaign comprising more than 10 exciting missions, the Career Mode offers the opportunity to develop their company completely freely while keeping an eye on their finances. In Sandbox Mode players can expect gaming fun without limits - thanks to unlimited financial resources, they can expand their company completely freely and as they wish. Meanwhile, newcomers can also look forward to a dedicated Driving School that familiarizes them step by step with the interactive cockpits and the controls of the trams.\n\nThanks to the sophisticated route editor, Tram Simulator Urban Transit gives players the opportunity to create their own tram lines, to optimize the timetables to meet the needs of the city and then, of course, drive the trams by themselves or with the help of the company's AI tram drivers. To expand their fleet, players can choose from 6 tram models including detailed, interactive cockpits - three different tram types, each in two lengths. During their journeys, players not only have to keep an eye on the route and traffic - they also have to deal with numerous random events, sell tickets and check the tickets of passengers traveling with them in order to catch fare dodgers.\n\nPlayers who don't just want to play alone, but also with friends, can look forward to a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to 4 players. All PC versions of the game are PC cross-play capable, so PC players can play together with other PC players in multiplayer - regardless of whether they have purchased their PC version of the game on Steam, via the Epic Games Store or the Microsoft Store! Meanwhile, cross-gen multiplayer support is available on consoles, allowing Xbox Series X|S players to play with Xbox One players and PlayStation 5 players to play with PlayStation 4 players to lead their shared public transport company to success as team.\n\nOwners of astragon\u2019s Bus Simulator 21 Next Stop - Season Pass or the Bus Simulator 21 Next Stop - Official Tram Extension automatically receive free access to Tram Simulator Urban Transit!
