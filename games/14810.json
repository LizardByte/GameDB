From the floating fortress of your golden gondola, you'll restore the city by returning its lost treasures. Sling costly coins, launch lovely lyres and ricochet ruby rings into the corresponding spaces overhead. Use your arsenal of special shots to create cascading combos and earn bonus points along the way. But beware shelves, chutes, swirlies and other traps will make things tricky, so you'll need power-ups like Wild Shot and Wings to help you sail through the levels. So grab your gondola and get ready with a majestic soundtrack, gloriously ornate artwork and four enduring game modes, Venice is a classic test of wits, will and skill.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/venice", "collections": [{"id": 3869, "name": "Genius"}]}
