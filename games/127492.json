The sun is your death timer. Hurtle towards the sunset at breakneck speed in a futile race against time. Delay the inevitable by catching speed boosts which reverse the setting sun - if only for a moment. Race The Sun: Daily Challenge Edition is inspired by arcade games of the past with a focus on high scores, short game sessions, and pure fun mingled with nerve-wracking tension. The rules are simple: don't crash, stay in the light, and don't slow down! \n \nThis new edition of the game includes several new features including new alternate ships, colorful new trails, and a new \"daily challenge\" system that will test the skills of even the most experienced players.", "videos": [{"id": 31971, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fHnB9khNMMo"}]}
