PvP used to be very tame in D4T, now it's not. It will make you remember vanilla Doom DM, where all weapons deal a ton of damage, and you better move and react fast to what's going on around you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nF.A.Q.\n\nQ: Are you including D4V monster sprites in this release?\nA: No. Not yet. Perhaps in the future, depends on permissions and adjustments we'd have to make.\n\nQ: Is this the last version of D4T?\nA: Not neccesarily. We may update it further based on time and our own schedule. There's more features we'd like to add, but this is not a full commitment.\n\nQ: Will you bring X feature/weapon/mechanic from Doom Eternal?\nA: No. This mod is and will remain to be based on Doom 2016. There may be rare exceptions, but only time will tell. But this is *NOT* \"Doom Eternal 4 Doom\"\n\nQ: Will you make a Doom Eternal 4 Doom mod?\nA: Unknown.
