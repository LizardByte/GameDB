Her tribe alone knows the truth of Hyrule's past, that Ganon, Zelda and Link are locked into an endless cycle of reincarnation, dooming Hyrule to continual recurring war. Din can break the cycle by finding and rejoining the three pieces of the broken triforce. Unfortunately, they are contained within the living bodies of Ganon, Zelda and Link, and the only way to get them out is to kill all three of them. Din must also find her two sisters, Nayru and Farore, who have gone out into Hyrule and never returned, for they hold the key to defeating the mysterious force that has kept the Goddesses from saving their world.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wheel-of-fate"}
