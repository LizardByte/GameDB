Choose from 27 different NBA teams and take to the court for incredible two-on-two action. Each NBA team is represented and there are plenty of hidden bonuses to uncover with each hard-earned victory. All of the flips, twists, shooting flames, and loose refereeing from the coin-operated original are present right down to the \"on fire\" streaks. If you make it too far into the game to lose your valuable progress, you can save your game with the use of a password. Whether you're looking for NBA basketball or a fast-paced brawl, you'll find plenty of both in NBA JAM."}
