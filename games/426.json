It was the final title in the series to feature two-dimensional graphics, and the first story that did not revolve around crystals.\n\nThe game gives players up to fourteen playable characters, the largest cast in the series, and features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system. A party can consist of up to four characters, though some events require the player to assemble three different parties of up to four and switch between them.\n\nEach character has a unique command ability, such as Terra's Trance, Locke's Steal, Edgar's Tools or Sabin's Blitz, and can also learn Magic spells from earning AP from battles with magicite equipped. Each character's rare Desperation Attack will randomly activate after using the Attack command when at critical health.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-vi", "videos": [{"id": 107429, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "72DmCaczYMc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DmCaczYMc", "title": "Final Fantasy 6 Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72DmCaczYMc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 108642, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "oWD1m3Q7AV4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWD1m3Q7AV4", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc\u2165 \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWD1m3Q7AV4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 108643, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "pEgrzE6oGKQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEgrzE6oGKQ", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcVI \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pEgrzE6oGKQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
