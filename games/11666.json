What it means to be human has changed with the coming of the singularity.\n\nIn the post-human economy, sentience is now the most valuable commodity in the universe. The only way to acquire more of that is through the control of Turinium \u2013 programmable matter \u2013 which can extend consciousness to levels we can't even imagine. Worlds are being transformed into this substance and wars are now being fought across the galaxy for control of those worlds.\n\nEach conflict takes place across an entire world. It isn't a skirmish. It's a war. Thousands of units are constantly constructed and sent across the planet with the player directing entire armies, in real time, to capture key resources in an effort to gain total control of the planet.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 7684, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "skzlVGU9Xl0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skzlVGU9Xl0", "title": "Ashes of the Singularity - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skzlVGU9Xl0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7685, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Aag1Y6yZ8I0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aag1Y6yZ8I0", "title": "Ashes of the Singularity - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aag1Y6yZ8I0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
