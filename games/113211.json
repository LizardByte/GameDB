It is a remake of Kirby's Star Stacker, which is known in Japan under exactly the same name as the remake. The game was originally released as a new title for the Nintendo Power flash RAM service, but was released in standard cartridge form a year later. It was intended for international release, but the SNES's lifespan ended in North America and Europe before the game could be localized in either region. The standard cartridge release of the game also came out in the exact year of the SNES's discontinuation in North America, further compounding its isolation. The game was the final title in the Kirby series officially published for Super Famicom.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirbys-super-star-stacker", "videos": [{"id": 37832, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QL5lImbFSis", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5lImbFSis", "title": "SNES - Kirby no KiraKira Kids (Part One)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QL5lImbFSis/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 57265, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CXZNbNq5WpI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZNbNq5WpI", "title": "\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304d\u3089\u304d\u3089\u304d\u3063\u305a \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXZNbNq5WpI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
