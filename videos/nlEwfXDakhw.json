{"id": "nlEwfXDakhw", "snippet": {"title": "znax release", "description": "Znax is a sort of puzzle / arcade game where you as the player need to select 4 blocks of the same color and form rectangles as big as you can. By doing this you will erase all blocks in this rectangle and they will be replaced by new blocks. You keep on doing this till the time runs out, and try to gain your highest score possible. There are two game modes, Relative timer and fixed Timer, in the first mode you'll also gain extra time for deleting blocks so you can play longer if you are fast enough. With the second mode you don't get extra time for deleting blocks but just points added to your score so here you try to get the highest amount of points in the given time period.\n\nThis is a new version of the game created with SDL2 and sources are available on github . The game also works on the raspberry pi and it's touchscreen as well as on linux. \n\nGithub Release: https://github.com/joyrider3774/Znax\n\n#znax #raspberrypi #puzzlegame #casual", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlEwfXDakhw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlEwfXDakhw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlEwfXDakhw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "znax release", "description": "Znax is a sort of puzzle / arcade game where you as the player need to select 4 blocks of the same color and form rectangles as big as you can.
