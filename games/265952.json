It is meant to educate players about the uses and misuses of drugs.\n\nYou play as Jo, who travels through strange and surreal worlds, collecting both points and drugs. Each drug found has a different effect: some merely distort the screen, but others have useful effects, such as shrinking Jo down so he can fit through small gaps.\n\nWhile reviews for both an Amiga and DOS version of the game were published, it is unknown if the game saw a proper release and only a shareware demo of the DOS version has been found.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wrecked-a-psychedelic-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 97659, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Uy0BBv4bfbo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy0BBv4bfbo", "title": "Wrecked A Psychedelic Adventure (Dos game 1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uy0BBv4bfbo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
