Now he is realizing that that battle has played out exactly as Master Xehanort had planned, and the second Keyblade War, the final struggle between light and dark, looms ahead. To counter the overwhelming darkness, Sora and his friends must gather the seven guardians of light. His best friend Riku and King Mickey seek out a battle-scarred Keyblade wielder, while Sora, Donald, and Goofy set off on a journey to find \u201cthe Key to Return Hearts.\u201d Never-before-featured Disney worlds set the stage for another daring adventure to save the universe!\n\nChosen by the Keyblade, he is the one whose heart\u2019s light never fails to shine as a beacon of hope.\n\nSora, the brave hero chosen by the Keyblade, has always had a strong sense of justice. Through his many battles against darkness, he has grown and learned about the world immensely. Drawn to his light, many friends have lent him their support and granted him their powers to counter the darkness: Riku, the childhood friend he grew up with on Destiny Islands; Donald and Goofy, the two brave comrades with whom he has shared his adventures from the very beginning; and King Mickey, who gives Sora his unfailing support. As the world becomes enveloped in another battle against darkness, the Keyblade wielder and his friends must rise up against Master Xehanort and thwart his plot to incite another Keyblade War.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts III is the third main installment in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix. It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.\n\nKingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii", "videos": [{"id": 20494, "name": "E3 2018 \"Frozen\" Trailer", "video_id": "gPtU_-N6dMg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPtU_-N6dMg", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III \u2013 E3 2018 Frozen Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gPtU_-N6dMg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 20607, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MRR30GSWZjc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRR30GSWZjc", "title": "Kingdom Hearts III - E3 2018 Pirates of the Caribbean Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRR30GSWZjc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 23046, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EunHzNTCpx8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EunHzNTCpx8", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III \u2013 LUCCA 2018 Tangled Trailer (Closed Captions)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EunHzNTCpx8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 23170, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0YSPmzVqfpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSPmzVqfpQ", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III \u2013 Winnie the Pooh Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0YSPmzVqfpQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 23767, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "a-fmsw5m0Ag", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-fmsw5m0Ag", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III \u2013 Together Trailer (Closed Captions)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a-fmsw5m0Ag/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 23768, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lz1w_uW3lSE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz1w_uW3lSE", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III \u2013 Final Battle Trailer (Closed Captions)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lz1w_uW3lSE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24259, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EElFaj4ezUU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EElFaj4ezUU", "title": "KINGDOM HEARTS III CM 120\u79d2\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebVer.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EElFaj4ezUU/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 13164, "name": "Woody"}, {"id": 13166, "name": "Hamm"}, {"id": 13168, "name": "Aliens"}, {"id": 13161, "name": "King Mickey"}, {"id": 13165, "name": "Buzz Lightyear"}, {"id": 13169, "name": "James P.
