However, the clubs with not many members have a problem on their hands: if they don\u2019t complete the task that the student council assigned them for the festival, then their club will be disbanded.\n\nFor the literary club which Ichigo was part of, they must prove that they deserve a club room and funds by selling 100 copies of their latest work. His childhood friend Mayuu, who used to be a famous actress, was worried about losing a place to call her own, while his underclassmen and writer Sena had no desire to join another club. However, they had only sold 35 copies at the last festival and they couldn\u2019t see how they could meet their goal with only the three of them in the club.\n\nThe leader of the 2-member drama club, Momoka, came to them and offered them with a solution. Their club would be disbanded if they didn\u2019t put on a great play at the culture festival, so she asked them to write a script for them and also to take part in the play. She also wanted Mayuu to return to the stage. Will the literature club and drama club successfully complete their tasks?", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/koi-suru-kanojo-no-bukiyou-na-butai"}
