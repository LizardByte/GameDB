The gameplay is also very different from other Lemmings games, focusing on splattering enemies with paint from a gun. The levels contain various puzzles including moving platforms, lemming catapults, and trampolines.\n\nObjects available in the game include:\n\nDuplicator: Can be used to create additional lemmings up to the maximum amount of four. Can also replace lemmings killed in action.\nSwitch: Can be used to open and close gates, lower platforms and so on.\nGate: Gates block certain areas in a level. They can be opened using a switch or key. Keys can be found in exploding crates.\nExploding crate: Contain a key or a catapult.\nBalloon: Can be used to transport a lemming through the air from one specific location to another.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lemmings-paintball", "collections": [{"id": 1118, "name": "Lemmings"}]}
