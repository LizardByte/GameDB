He was very excited and scared. A human body had just been brought to the morgue but he said that it was an unusual corpse. He recommended that I come as soon as possible if I wanted to be the first to receive materials for an article that could become a real sensation.\n\nAfter 20 minutes I was already in the morgue and what I saw shocked me.\n\nReturning home with the materials, I became a hostage in my own house, with a terrible creature prowling the corridors. The only salvation is a bright flash on the camera, which scares away the creature. I need to deal with all the closed doors and solve these damn riddles... No way in hell I'm gonna die. I must get out at any cost.", "summary": "SNAP SNAP is a first-person psychological horror game with an oppressive atmosphere and intense gameplay. Use your camera to escape the monster and solve some puzzles. Use the charge sparingly, as the battery may run out and while it is charging at the station... you are defenseless. The game has four endings. Will you be able to open them all? Beautiful graphics, oppressive atmosphere and high-quality sound will help you fully immerse yourself in the terrifying world of SNAP SNAP.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snap-snap", "videos": [{"id": 122676, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "B524mcey_08", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B524mcey_08", "title": "SNAP SNAP - Release Trailer.
