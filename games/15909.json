Watch out for the spiders they have a particular fondness for rubber encased scientist brains. After landing, you will move from room to room through the facility blasting rockets, lasers, and wielding the power of lighting upwards at anything not human. Ravenous swarms and ferocious waves of bugs of every size will attempt to kill you, but luckily there will be weapon and health pick-ups to aid Harry on his quest.\n\nFierce reflexes are mandatory for survival, but Harry's brutal power-ups will let the guts fly and make the larva cry! If you love games with humor, perfect platforming, grotesquely cute art, nightmarish bosses, and real personality then The Bug Butcher will suit your fancy.", "summary": "The Bug Butcher is an action-packed 2D side scrolling shoot em up game where peril comes from above. The core mechanics hold old ties from the classic arcade shooter \"Super Pang\" where you shoot vertically, but with modern day twists. You are Harry, a brash and tenacious exterminator who has a knack for decimating bugs. Harry's current assignment takes him to an infested futuristic research facility on a distant planet. The surviving and dwindling number of scientists employed him for his slaughtering skills.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 6661, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ss0QIdxN8as"}, {"id": 6662, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ETUlGk0VyxI"}, {"id": 6813, "name": "Pre-launch Trailer", "video_id": "Tez96jb5Exg"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Ff9fUB8uK2o"}]}
