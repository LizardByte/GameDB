However, the talented noblewoman Michinaga told him that everyone is unique and he should be himself. Because of this, he continued to study hard and vowed to protect her. The most powerful onmyouji Senmei told him that he is useless and is just a burden to everyone else in the world, and end up taking Michinaga away from him. He devised a stupid plan to oppose her, but how can the weakest guy like him defeat a genius like her? On top of that, suspected of planning an assassination against Michinaga, he was driven from the city. Now alone except for with Michinaga\u2019s cousin Akimitsu, who is just as dumb as he is, how will he be able to gain revenge against Senmei?\n\nThis is an SLG using actual figures such as the protagonist Ashiya Douman and Abeno Senmei (although now female). Of course the setting is a bit different being in a girl\u2019s school, and there\u2019s robots and stuff as well. During the ADV parts, you can sneak in as a girl to gain intelligence, or go and equip yourself for the battles during the SLG part. A jankenpon system similar to Koihime is used although onmyouji attacks trump all 3 types (infantry, spearmen and archers). There are light and dark elements which also modify damage, and there are area elements as well.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shikigami"}
