The game's combat system is turn-based at core, but requires the player to press buttons in a rapid succession and with precise timing to execute attacks. The characters can store up energy to unleash a stronger attack later. Using the technique named Carta, they can also perform various special moves which are based on elemental affinities.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magna-carta-tears-of-blood", "videos": [{"id": 132263, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7nJvuYP5eLU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nJvuYP5eLU", "title": "Magna Carta: Tears of Blood - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7nJvuYP5eLU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
