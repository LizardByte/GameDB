Like the other part 1 videos of the other games, I deliberately only played for just a little more than two hours because I figured there would be some lag. And while there is a little bit it's not much. But I still didn't want to take any chances.\n\nSmall note, but I actually wanted to get two story missions done here, but the protected area required Virus Core J which I didn't have. So I went to a random dungeon in hopes that I'd find the right creatures, but they were all to large. Only later do I find out that it expected me to get the right virus cores from the first story mission. While I could've done that, I just figured I'd take care of the dungeon I was working on anyway.\n\n\nThere will be more story missions completed in the next video. But at least I managed to obtain all the Grunties and at the end, I'll race will them. So stay tuned for the next video and if you liked this video or any of my others and want to see more, feel free to subscribe and like always, Enjoy!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qF0w0orDgJg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qF0w0orDgJg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qF0w0orDgJg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[PS2 Longplay] .hack//QUARANTINE Part 1", "description": "Here it is.
