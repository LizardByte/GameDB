Your memories of events are a little hazy at best, and exactly where you are and how you got here is a mystery. Still, you've got a road cone on your head, so it can't have been all bad.", "summary": "Ever wondered what else goes on in the strange setting that surrounds the tale of Borrack? Well, now you can.\n\nPlay Tangled Tales as either Cinderella or Prince Charming as you attempt to find your way back to the family castle in time for your friend's wedding, encountering all manner of rude, annoying and often unhelpful fairy tale folk, intent it seems, on hindering you."}
