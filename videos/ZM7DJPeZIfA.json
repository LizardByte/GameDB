Get back to work with a vehicle fleet whose size will knock your socks off. Beyond brands like Caterpillar, CASE and BELL that are already familiar in the Construction Simulator series, you can get behind the wheel of new licensed machines from partners like DAF and Doosan \u2013 over 90 in total.\u202f\u202f\n\nBuild to your heart\u2019s content on two maps, inspired by landscapes in the USA and Germany.\u202f\n\nOver 90 exciting tasks are waiting to be completed in both maps combined, so there\u2019s always something new to explore!\u202f\n\nEach map has its own campaign through which you become the owner of your own construction company. As you start from scratch assisted by your mentor Hape, you get bigger and more interesting jobs to grow your company and expand your fleet. You\u2019ll also meet different clients that will challenge you. Tasks like renovating the harbor area to attract more tourists or helping the struggling inner city to recover will demand all your skills.\u202f\u202f\n\nOn the European map inspired by the idyllic cities of Southwest Germany, you\u2019ll find rolling hills and beautiful riversides. In Friedenberg your mission is to help design solutions for renewable energy and improve the city\u2019s infrastructure during the campaign. Aside from these larger jobs, you\u2019ll get assorted tasks to test out every bit of equipment that you earn. Take pride in your accomplishments as you ride through the city!\u202f\u202f\n\nOf course, players can look forward to familiar brands and machines from previous installments of the franchise. All these officially licensed partners come with familiar machines and new ones \u2013 sporting improved looks: Atlas, BELL, Bobcat, Bomag, CASE, Caterpillar\u00a9, Kenworth, Liebherr, MAN, Mack Trucks, Meiller-Kipper, Palfinger, Still, and the Wirtgen Group.\u202f\u202f\n\nIn addition to the known license partners, players can enjoy a new selection: Benninghoven of the Wirtgen Group, Cifa, DAF, Doosan, Nooteboom, Scania, Schwing Stetter and Wacker Neuson. Enjoy officially licensed personal protection equipment for your player character with the new license partner Engelbert Strauss. \u202f\n\nLook forward to over 90 machines from these license partners, all faithfully recreating their real-life counterparts. Not only can you grow your own construction empire, you can also invite up to three friends to join you.
