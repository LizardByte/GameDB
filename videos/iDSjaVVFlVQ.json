Tap Spidey's hand on the interface to shoot a web burst. Tap and hold both hands to latch on to an enemy with a web. Spin and let go to throw it out of the way.\n\nScan special AR markers embedded on the back of Kellogg's cereal and snack foods packaging (ranging from Frosted Flakes to Pop Tarts and Pringles) to unlock different levels. Each level, themed on scenes from the feature (Times Square, Oscorp and City Streets) presents new challenges and introduces Electro, who throws everything from taxis to fire hydrants to bicycle racks in an attempt to stop you.\n\nSpecial in-game power-ups replenish health while others provide web shields. If you're proud of your score, post it to the global leaderboard or share your score via Facebook and Twitter.\n\nGame strategy includes quick-to-pick-up game mechanics and a free-play demo level that is capped at a certain score. This provides instant engagement, while also motivating users to seek out products to unlock additional game-play. In addition, the snap-and-share Spidey Suit feature is positioned prominently on the main menu.
