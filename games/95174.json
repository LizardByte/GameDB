Players shoot or bump the ball onto the other team's side and score a point when the ball hits the ground in a scoring area. Players can jump, or launch each other with missiles to their heart's content. If the other team is doing a good job of keeping the ball up try sitting on it! There's nothing to stop you from invading their half of the court!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tank-ball"}
