There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.\n\nThe story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens. This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel. After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/master-of-the-monster-lair", "videos": [{"id": 25937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fkZBoLpGF8Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZBoLpGF8Y", "title": "Master of the Monster Lair: Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fkZBoLpGF8Y/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
