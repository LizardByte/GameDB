Set somewhere after the year 2010, Nebula Fighter puts the player into the role of a lone ship pilot who needs to break through the defenses of a space-faring alien race. The twist is that instead of an alien invasion scenario, the humans are actually the aggressors bent on conquering the alien homeworld. Nebula Fighter features a variety of weapons, which can be powered up by picking upgrades during play. Each level ends with a battle against a unique boss. Once a boss is defeated, the player can pick up its weapon to use in the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
