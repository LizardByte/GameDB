It is the successor to NCAA Football 06 in the NCAA Football series. The product features former USC player Reggie Bush on the cover. While there weren't any stunning new features added to the PS2 and Xbox games, tweaks were added to improve the existing features.\n\nThe theme for 07 is \"Turn the Tide.\" Like the 2005 version said for home-field advantage, this year's version emphasizes that momentum is more important in college football than any other sport. This is illustrated by a momentum meter on the score graphic at the top (or bottom, in the case of the Xbox 360 version) of the screen. The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points).\n\nNCAA Football 07 also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in Madden), ESPN integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes. ESPN integration is expected to increase with the next NCAA Football releases."}
