The KGB is still the most feared and pervasive intelligence-gathering network in the world. But now, the KGB itself is under secret surveillance - by you.\n\nYour superior at Department P in Moscow has just given you your first assignment: find out who murdered private detective Golitsin and why. This is just the first of his attempts to test your loyalty to the hardliners. But - who can you trust? - your Uncle Vanya, who seems to know more about the grisly murder of your parents than he is letting on? Or your superiors, whose own hidden agendas might even include the overthrow of Gorbachev?\n\nQuestions lead to more questions but one think is clear - the KGB reeks of corruption and you're about as save as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.\n\nBe advised, comrade - you must act quickly and shrewdly to uncover the conspirators before they uncover you.", "summary": "KGB is an Adventure game, developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Virgin Games, which was released in 1992.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kgb", "videos": [{"id": 48229, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2s2Q5RvXkzc"}]}
