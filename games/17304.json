Unlike in traditional twin stick shooters, in Particle Mace, you destroy your enemies by swinging giant boulders at your enemies. It takes a deep understanding of your own weight, thrust, and inertia in order to be a master Particle Mace gladiator, but once you get in the zone, this game satisfies like no other.\n\nPARTICLE MACE is explosive arcade fun for 1-4 players that pays homage to twitch games of the past, but replaces the typical guns with an unruly physics-based weapon. Take control of a tiny ship in an extremely hostile universe, and defend yourself as long as possible from enemy ships and asteroids using a collection of trash particles tethered to the ship. To survive, you must carefully navigate around the many hazards while building up momentum to swing your weapon into your foes or your friends, all in a field of brightly abstracted visuals and an entrancing procedural background.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 56377, "video_id": "zJEIuzdBsCw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEIuzdBsCw", "title": "PARTICLE MACE Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zJEIuzdBsCw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 56384, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zJEIuzdBsCw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEIuzdBsCw", "title": "PARTICLE MACE Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zJEIuzdBsCw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
