The player is sent to a 100% hand-painted dream world called Onirium, where they encounter Moti, a small scared monster with no memory, symbolizing the need to live with our inner fears. Together, they embark on a journey of self-discovery, using empathy and courage to overcome obstacles and find their way back home, without letting fear dominate them. In My Monsters, the player will navigate through various 3D environments, facing enemies, collecting items, and solving puzzles to progress. With the help of the small Moti, they must confront the 3 Vassals of the God of Emptiness: the Executioner of Anxiety; the Herald of Fear; and the Lord of Loneliness. Each of them, with their own story and unique gameplay, is a sensitive and profound invitation to reflect on our anxieties, the power of friendships, and the courage we need to face difficult situations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-monsters", "videos": [{"id": 118052, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ks-5RDvyxEk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks-5RDvyxEk", "title": "My Monsters - Inscri\u00e7\u00e3o BIG 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ks-5RDvyxEk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
