But now, even as the memories of battle have begun to fade, a new evil grows inside Vana'diel...\n\nAnd it hungers for the power of the crystals.", "summary": "This collection extends the 2007 compilation with the inclusion of the fourth expansion pack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-xi-vanadiel-collection-2008", "videos": [{"id": 32539, "name": "Opening Movie", "video_id": "-CUepYCA4c8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CUepYCA4c8", "title": "FINAL FANTASY XI \u2013 Opening movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-CUepYCA4c8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
