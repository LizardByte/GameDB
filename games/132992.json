The North American and European versions keep the original Title: \"Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together\".\nThe PSP remake presents several changes compared to the previous releases. New characters and events are included, and the script has been re-translated. Most importantly, the remake severely downplays the effects of a character's death in battle, giving players extra opportunities to keep characters alive even if their hit points have been reduced to zero in battle. The previous releases permanently eliminated characters once their hit points had been reduced to zero in battle. The remake also adds a crafting system and completely revamps the experience system, giving experience to all the party members after a battle, instead of giving it to single party members after executing individual actions", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together--1", "videos": [{"id": 72223, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cgH1oHxS4cg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgH1oHxS4cg", "title": "Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together (PSP) trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgH1oHxS4cg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1313, "name": "Ogre Battle"}]}
