The box on the game prominently featured new NASCAR star Kevin Harvick in the Goodwrench #29 car, a driver missing from NASCAR 4 as the game was released very shortly before the death of Dale Earnhardt. Also featured on the cover; Terry Labonte in the Kellogg's #5 car, Dale Jarrett in the UPS #88 car, (in the background) Jeff Burton in the Citgo #99 car, Ward Burton in the Caterpillar Inc. #22 car and Ken Schrader in the M&M's #36 car.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nascar-racing-2002-season"}
