It is a chaotic game of luck in which players take turns rolling dice in an attempt to reach the center of the board by exact count. Winning and losing are never certain. Unlucky players will lose turns or be pushed back, but players who land on the spaces bearing geese can cross the board quickly.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-game-of-the-goose--1"}
