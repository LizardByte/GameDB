You will fight your way through undead hordes near the bombed-out city of Nuremberg and help Hermann Wolff, the Deadhunter\u2019s legendary leader, find his scattered family and fight to free Europe from the zombie apocalypse.\n\nVR brings a new level of immersion to the nail-biting action of the Zombie Army series. Use both hands to aim down the sights of your rifle and line up that perfect shot at range. When things get up close and personal, use each hand independently to dual-wield pistols and submachine guns. You will also need to master reloading drills as the undead masses bear down on you from all sides. Overcoming your nerves and operating under pressure will be crucial if you are to succeed.\n\nTo help send the undead scourge back into the abyss, you will have access to an arsenal of authentic World War II weaponry including sniper rifles, submachine guns, pistols, and more. You will also need to earn XP to level up your Deadhunter as you fight zombie-infested 1940s Europe, and use Weapon Upgrade kits to modify the range, accuracy, scope, and ammo capacity of your weapons.\n\nGame Features:\n\u2022 New spine-chilling campaign\n\u2022 Authentic World War II weaponry and impactful melee combat\n\u2022 Relive devastating long-range shots with the signature X-ray Kill Cam\n\u2022 VR enhances the expressive interactions & tactile experience of the Zombie Army franchise\n\u2022 Player progression and weapon modification\n\u2022 Slay alone or take the fight online and join a friend for 2 player co-op\n\u2022 Competitive arcade-style scoring system \n\u2022 bHaptics and Forcetube support on Quest and PCVR\n\u2022 Wide range of accessibility features including colour blindness, audio, rotation options, and more.\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/zombiearmytrilogy/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZombieArmy\nRebellion Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rebelliondevelopments/\nZombie Army Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/zombiearmyofficial/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@rebelliondevelopments\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/rebellion_official\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/rebellion \nFind out more about Rebellion at https://rebellion.com/ \nFind out more about Zombie Army at https://zombiearmy.com/\n\n#rebellion #zombiearmy #PSVR2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RDeQxyvLMg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RDeQxyvLMg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RDeQxyvLMg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RDeQxyvLMg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RDeQxyvLMg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zombie Army VR - Reveal Trailer | PS VR2, Meta Quest Platforms & PCVR", "description": "Add Zombie Army VR to your WISHLIST NOW at http://reb.to/ZAVR\n\nBringing the Zombie Army franchise to VR for the first time, the game will let you experience the fear, thrill and spine-chilling tension of the zombie apocalypse through the immersion of your headset. \n\nDeveloped in partnership with XR Games, Zombie Army VR will be available on PlayStation\u00ae VR2, Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro, Oculus Rift, and PC headsets via Steam in 2024.\n\nFollowing the story of the Zombie Army series, in Zombie Army VR you return to the field as one of the Deadhunters, an elite squad that is hunting down zombie war criminals.
