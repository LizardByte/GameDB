Pressing on to the east he decided to conduct a winter campaign in Poland. Facing him were the Russian army and the Prussian corps of Gen. Lt. L'Estocq. After the initial campaign in December, where his forces were unable to decisively defeat the Allies at the Battles of Pultusk and Golymin, Napoleon decided to put his army into winter quarters. The Russians, under the command of General Bennigsen, came out of winter quarters to engage in offensive operations and nearly defeated Mar\u00e9chal Bernadotte's I Corps at Mohrungen. The Allies drove on Guttstadt and Allenstein but the French outmaneuvered them and the Allies were compelled to retreat. Following these actions the French army took the offensive and drove the Russians back on Eylau where both sides fought to a bloody draw. Both armies went back into winter quarters to emerge and engage once again in battle in June with the French army emerging victorious at Friedland.\n\nCommand the French at Eylau and try and defeat Bennigsen's Russian army through blinding snow of February or as the Allies defeat Napoleon at Heilsberg. At Friedland, lead your French legions to victory or as General-Lieutenant Essen at the First Battle of Ostraleka try and defeat Mar\u00e9chal Lannes' V Corps before it can unite. Twenty-two historical battles await your pleasure including Eylau, where the Prussians arrived to save the day, or at Heilsberg where Napoelon's subordinates unwisely attacked the prepared positions of the Russian right wing. Can you as Mar\u00e9chal Bernadotte at Mohrungen defeat the Russians before more of their forces arrive? Will your French forces under Mar\u00e9chal Ney be decimated by the more numerous forces of the Russians at G\u00fcttstadt or will the French VI Corps live to fight another day? All this and more awaits you in Campaign Eylau-Friedland.", "summary": "Campaign Eylau-Friedland recreates the battles of the campaign in Poland of 1806-07. These were fought initially in the frozen countryside of Poland and East Prussia during the winter months of December through February and in the spring of 1807 at the end of which the French and their allies emerged victorious. Now you can take control of either the French or Allied armies and refight the famous battles which decided the fate of the Fourth Coalition and brought about the birth of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and saw the Allies foiled once again by Napoleon.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/campaign-eylau-friedland"}
