The game is also the final title to be recognizably similar in presentation to the original.\n\nBuilding upon the success of Puzzle Bobble 3, the game adds a pulley system that requires two sets of bubbles, attached to either side of a rope hanging across two pulleys. The game contains a story mode for single player play.\n\nIn total, the game features 640 levels. The console version features a level editor to either create and save a level, set a succession of levels, or to create an unlimited amount of extra levels and stages. It also has an alternative \"story mode\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
