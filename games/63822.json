They attempted to invade the uncharted eastern lands, but suffered total defeat at the hands of demons more intelligent than humans. Three hundred years later, the land of the gods, Shinshuu, has locked itself away from all foreign countries, but an air of gloom begins to drift in from the east. They are forced to head east again to drive away the demons. \n \nAn updated released titled Kajiri Kamui Kagura: Akebono no Hikari was released in 2013 for Windows and Playstation Vita, adding new chapters and features to the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 39810, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GLtf-1qnDY4"}]}
