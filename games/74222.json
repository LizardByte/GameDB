What could go wrong, right? \nTime for you to board on a brand new adventure filled with humor, cases (this time many cases!), mysteries, and even more characters now than ever before! Will you be able to gather clues, solve the puzzles, succeed the trials, and find the culprit before reaching the final station?!", "summary": "Someone has been killing passengers on the express train from Lisbon to Porto, every single day since Tuesday!
