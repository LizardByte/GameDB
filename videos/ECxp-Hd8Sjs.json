These two stand far and above any other games ever made, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOne of them is Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

I don't think I could possibly give S3K a ton of attention without also giving it to RC2. It'd be like picking a favourite child.\n\nSince there aren't enough Rollcage: Stage II videos on YouTube, I'm fixing that. I'll be covering EVERY mode - all of the Campaigns, all of the Time Trial modes, Training, Scramble, Survivor, Demolition, All Tracks, Pursuit, Combat, and even Rubble Soccer. I'll also go back at the end and play Masters with the cheat that makes it even harder, with Mirror Mode on to show that off too.\n\nThis game needs more love, and this year, I'm giving it.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECxp-Hd8Sjs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECxp-Hd8Sjs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECxp-Hd8Sjs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECxp-Hd8Sjs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Rollcage: Stage II - Intro", "description": "There are two games I revere as the greatest games ever made.
